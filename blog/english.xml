        <markdown-content>This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Jonathan Izard.\nWorld leaders are in Buenos Aires for a G20 summit already marked by tensions and disagreements, many of them caused by President Trump's combative stance on trade and climate change. Tensions have been further inflamed by Russia's military action against Ukraine. James Landale is at the summit. President Putin is likely to face tough questions over Russia seizure of Ukrainian vessels. President Trump said he wouldn't meet the Russian leader until the confrontation was resolved. And Mohammad bin Salman the Saudi Crown Prince is also in town looking to repair his reputation after the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But for all these tensions, European leaders said it was important for the G20 to come together to tackle the world's problems.\nBefore the summit formally got underway, the United States, Canada and Mexico signed a new trade deal. This is seen as a victory for Mr. Trump who opposed the previous agreement. Andrew Walker reports. Many barriers to commerce between the US, Canada and Mexico were removed or reduced by the North American Free Trade Agreement, which came into force a quarter of a century ago. But President Trump called it the worst trade deal ever. Now, the three leaders have signed a replacement which keeps much of the original agreement. But it includes additional provisions that will, for example, make it more expensive for car makers to use parts from outside the region and will mean more opportunities for US dairy farmers to sell their milk products in Canada. It has been a contentious negotiation and there were reports that late disputes about the dairy issue might have held up the signing ceremony.\nInternational Olympic Committee says it's freezing all planning for the boxing tournament at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics because of concerns about the sport's governing body. It's launching an inquiry into the International Boxing Association AIBA over its governance, ethics and financial management. Our sports correspondent Alex Capstick reports. The IOC halted preparations for the Olympic boxing tournament in Tokyo, including the qualifying process following talks among the organization's leading officials in the Japanese capital. For several months, serious concerns have been expressed over the way the sport's governing body has been run. It came to a head earlier this month when Gafur Rahimov was elected as president of AIBA, despite allegations that he's part of an international criminal network, something he's always denied. But whatever is ultimately decided regarding the future of AIBA, the IOC still wants boxing to be part of the Tokyo Games.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n![bbc-20181204.jpg](images/bbc-20181204.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n这里是BBC新闻，大家好，我是乔纳森·伊泽德。\n世界各国领导人现正在布宜诺斯艾利斯参加G20峰会，峰会已表现出了紧张和分歧，许多是因为特朗普总统在贸易和气候变化上的好斗态度引发。俄罗斯对乌克兰采取的军事行动又进一步加重了大会的紧张氛围。以下是詹姆斯·兰德尔的报道。普京很有可能会因俄罗斯扣押乌克兰船只而面临尖锐的提问。特朗普表示在对峙解决之前他不会与普京见面。沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨尔曼也来到了这里，试图挽回一下因沙特记者贾马尔·哈苏及被杀事件而受损的名声。虽然本次大会充满了紧张气氛，欧洲领导人表示最重要的是各国能聚在一起解决世界问题。\n在峰会正式开始之前，美国、加拿大和墨西哥签署了一份新的贸易协议。这被认为是特朗普的胜利，因为他反对之前的协议。以下是安德鲁·沃克的报道。北美自由贸易协定消除或降低了很多美国、加拿大和墨西哥之间的贸易壁垒，该协议在25年之前正式生效，但是特朗普称这是有史以来最差的贸易协议。现在这三名领导人已经签署了一个替代协议，保留了很多之前的协议内容。但是也新增了一些附加条款，比如汽车生产商使用该区域之外零件将会更加昂贵，另外也会更有利于美国奶农向加拿大销售奶制品。协商的过程很激烈，有报道称近期的乳制品问题争端或延长签字仪式。\n国际奥组委称正在冻结2020年东京奥运会的拳击比赛筹备工作，原因其管理机构存在问题。它正在对国际拳击联盟AIBA的管理情况、道德和金融状况进行调查。以下是本台体育通讯员亚历克斯·卡普斯蒂克的报道。国际奥组委停止了东京奥运会拳击比赛的筹备工作，包括资格赛，此前奥组委主要官员在日本首都举行了会谈。几个月以来，国际奥组委一直都在担心该体育机构的运作方式。本月初，加弗尔·拉西莫夫成功当选 AIBA主席，事情也达到了非做不可的地步，拉西莫夫被指是国际犯罪网络成员，但他本人否认。无论AIBA的前景如何，国际奥组委仍然希望拳击项目出现在东京奥运会上。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>I'm Stuart Mackintosh with the BBC News, hello. The French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned the outbreak of violence at anti-government protests in Paris, saying it had nothing to do with a lawful expression of legitimate grievances. He was speaking after the latest protest saw the demonstrators attack police and spray graffiti on the Arch of Triumph. This report from Hugh Schofield. Demonstrators, some of them clearly agitators rather than bona fide yellow vests have fought running battles with police. They have torn up cobblestones to serve as projectiles and set fire to cars and even buildings. Police responded with tear gas and anti-riot grenades. What's been happening today takes the "yellow vest" movement to a new level. The scenes unforgettably vivid are of destruction. President Macron who's in Argentina at the G20 needs urgently to find a way out of this confrontation.\nMexico's new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to scrap the neoliberal economic policies of the past twenty five years. Speaking at his inauguration ceremony and Congress, Mr. Lopez Obrador said neoliberalism had led to poverty, crime and mass migration in Mexico and promised a new start. Starting from now, a peaceful and orderly transformation has begun that at the same time will be profound and radical, because we will end the corruption and impunity that impede Mexico's rebirth. The left-wing leader also announced the creation of a free trade zone in a vast area next to the border with the United States, where taxes will be lower and the minimum wage higher.\nThe African Union says it's worried about the lack of progress of peace talks for Burundi and has urged all sides to refrain from taking any judicial action that could cause further rifts. The warning comes a day after the Burundian government issued an international arrest warrant for the former President Pierre Buyoya and sixteen high ranking officials. Will Ross reports. The warning from the African Union appears to be aimed at the government of Burundi. Peace talks with the opposition have stalled and some feared the government has risked opening old ethnic wounds by issuing the arrest warrant for the former President Pierre Buyoya. The move is an awkward one for the African Union because Mr. Buyoya is now working for the AU as its special representative in Mali. The 1993 assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first Hutu leader triggered the civil war in which three hundred thousand people were killed. That was Will Ross. This is the world news from the BBC.\n![bbc-20181205.jpg](images/bbc-20181205.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是斯图亚特·麦金托什，欢迎收听BBC新闻。法国总统马克龙谴责了巴黎反政府游行暴力事件，称这根本不是表达不满的合法方式。在最近的示威活动中，游行人群袭击了警察，还在凯旋门上涂鸦，之后法国总统做了这番讲话。以下是休·斯科菲尔德的报道。许多游行者很明显是鼓动者而不是真正的“黄马甲”抗议人士，他们与警察打起了游击战。他们将鹅卵石当作投掷物，点燃汽车甚至是建筑物。警察用催泪弹和防爆手雷进行了反击。今天发生的事情让“黄马甲”运动再次升级。这里到处都是毁灭的景象，让人历历在目。总统马克龙正在阿根廷参加G20峰会，他正迫切地想解决冲突的方法。\n墨西哥新总统安德烈斯·曼努埃尔·洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔承诺将会取消施行25年的新自由经济政策。洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔在就职仪式和国会上表示新自由经济政策导致了贫穷、犯罪和大规模移民，他承诺墨西哥将会有一个新的开始。现在，一个和平有序的变革已经开始，同时它也是深刻彻底的，因为我们会根除阻碍墨西哥重生的贪污和法外逃脱。这名左翼领导人还宣布将会在与美国接壤的广阔区域开创一个自由贸易区，这里的税率将会更低，最低工资也会更高。\n非洲联盟称他们对布隆迪和平谈判没有进展感到担心，并且敦促各方避免采取可能导致分歧加深的任何司法行动。在非盟发出警告的前一天，布隆迪政府发布了对前总统皮埃尔·布约亚和16名高级官员的国际逮捕令。以下是威尔·罗斯的报道。非盟的警告很明显是针对布隆迪政府的。布隆迪政府与反对党的和平谈判已经陷于僵局，一些人担心政府将会通过发布前总统皮埃尔·布约亚的逮捕令重新揭开之前的民族伤疤。此举让非盟处于一个尴尬的境地，因为布约亚现正为非盟工作，在马里任特派代表。1993年，该国首个胡图族领袖，总统梅尔基奥尔·恩达达耶被刺杀，这引发了国内战争，导致30万人被杀。以上是威尔·罗斯的报道。BBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Jonathan Izard.\nOn his first full day in office, Mexico's new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has signed a decree creating a truth commission to investigate the disappearance of 43 students four years ago. The incident sparked weeks of protests. Will Grant reports.\nThe whole government is going to help with this plan. President Lopez Obrador told the victims' families who had gathered for the event, "and I can assure you that there will be no impunity either in this sad and painful case or in any other." It has been more than four years since the group of 43 young men and women were disappeared allegedly by State Security Forces. The lack of meaningful action or any prosecution of those involved was a stain on the previous administration, and human rights groups have long called for a new investigation.\nOne of Afghanistan's top sports officials has admitted for the first time that players in the women's national football squad and in other sports have been sexually abused and the problem must be addressed. The allegations of years of rape, sexual harassment and sexual coercion have been voiced publicly by a former captain of the women's football team. Jill McGivering reports.\nThe comments by Hafizullah Rahimithe, the head of Afghanistan's National Olympic Committee are the first official acknowledgment that the allegations of abuse made by some Afghan women footballers may be credible. Khalida Popal, a former team captain has been trying for years to highlight sexual assault, harassment and bullying by coaches and officials, which she claims to have witnessed and had reported to her. Officials in the Afghanistan Football Federation say the claims are untrue. Women involved in other sports have also spoken to the BBC,but are frightened of being identified.\nAn eighty-year-old woman has become the latest casualty of anti-government protests in France. She died in hospital in the southern city of Marseille after being hit in the face by a tear gas canister as she drew the shutters of her fourth floor apartment during rioting on Saturday. Three other deaths have been blamed on the protests.\nTwo jailed Catalan separatist leaders have announced that they're going on hunger strike from Tuesday, joining two colleagues who stopped eating at the weekend. Joaquim Forn and Josep Rull, said they were protesting against the Constitutional Court's refusal to let them appeal to European Courts against pretrial detention. The trials of nine Catalan separatists who have been held in jail for up to fourteen months are due to begin in January. Uruguay has rejected an asylum request by the former President of Peru Alan Garcia, who's under investigation for corruption. He entered Uruguay's embassy in Lima two weeks ago after a court banned him from leaving the country for the next eighteen months. Mr. Garcia says the allegations are politically motivated. The Uruguayan government praised Peru's legal system.\nThis is the world news from the BBC.\n![bbc-20181206.jpg](images/bbc-20181206.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n这里是BBC新闻，大家好，我是乔纳森·伊泽德。\n在墨西哥新任总统安德烈斯·曼努埃尔·洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔就职的第一天，他签署了一项法令启动一个真相调查委员会，调查4年前43名学生失踪一案。该事件也引发了数周的抗议活动。以下是威尔·格兰特的报道。\n政府将全力协助实施该计划。洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔总统对集结的受害者家属表示，“我能向你们保证，在该起沉重悲痛的案中或是在任何其他的案件中，凶手都逃脱不了惩罚。”当时据国家安全部队称有43名年轻男女失踪，此时距此已过去四年多的时间了。上一届政府没有实质性作为，也没有对涉案人员提起诉讼，这已经成为他们的一个污点，另外，人权组织在很久之前就要求对此展开新的调查。\n一名阿富汗体育部门高官首次承认国家女子足球队以及其他体育队的运动员受到性侵害，并称该问题必须要得到解决。女子足球队的前队长公开发声，称她们受到多年的强奸、性骚扰和性胁迫。以下是吉尔·麦吉弗林的报道。\n阿富汗国家奥委会主席哈飞祖拉·拉西梅斯所做出的评论是官方首次承认，阿富汗女足队员提出的性侵指控或许是可信的。哈莉达·博帕尔是一名前队长，多年来她一直试图曝光球队教练和官员的性侵、性骚扰和霸凌行为，她声称曾亲眼目睹也向主席报告过这些行为。阿富汗足协官员表示这些指控并非事实。其他项目的女队员也向BBC说了这件事，但她们害怕被认出来。\n一名80岁的女性成为法国反政府游行活动的又一位遇难者。她在法国南部城市马赛市的医院中去世，死因是在周六暴乱中，她在四楼房间里拉百叶窗时被一枚催泪弹击中面部。还有其他三名遇难者死于抗议活动中。\n两名被监禁的加泰罗尼亚分裂主义领导人宣布他们将从周二开始绝食抗议，他们的两名同事早在上周就开始了绝食。乔吉姆·弗恩和约瑟夫·罗尔表示，他们是在抗议宪法法庭拒绝让他们就审前羁押向欧洲法庭提起上诉，狱中的九名加泰罗尼亚分裂主义分子被判监禁14个月之久，并将从一月份开始服刑。乌拉圭拒绝了秘鲁前总统阿兰·加西亚的庇护请求，现在他正在接受腐败调查。两周之前，法院判定他在未来18个月内不得出国，之后他来到乌拉圭驻利马大使馆。加西亚表示这些指控都带有政治动机的，而乌拉圭则称赞了秘鲁的法律体系。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>I'm Stuart Mackintosh with the BBC News, hello.\nThe British Prime Minister Theresa May has opened a crucial five-day debate on Brexit by warning Parliament that the choice is between her deal, no deal and no Brexit.\nDon't let anyone here think that there's a better deal to be won by shouting louder. Don't imagine that if we vote this down, a different deal is going to miraculously appear. The alternative is uncertainty and risk. So I promise you today, this is the very best deal for the British people. I ask you to back it in the best interests of our constituents and our country.\nDuring the debate, Mrs. May said the EU had neither the time nor the inclination to reopen negotiations before Britain leaves next March.\nThe US Special Counsel Robert Mueller says Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn should face little or no prison time for giving what he called substantial assistance to the Russian election meddling probe. Mr. Mueller is leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. In court documents filed on Tuesday, Robert Mueller said Mr. Flynn has given first-hand details of contacts between Mr. Trump's transition team and Russian government officials.\nUS stocks have fallen sharply on fears of an economic slowdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day in nearly three months. All of the major US indexes ended the trading day down by more than three percent.\nWe've seen all of the major indexes down more than three percent. You've got bank stocks leading the way, but it wasn't just bank stocks, it was transportation stocks, industrial stocks, Caterpillar, General Electric. A lot of this has to do with concerns or warning signals flashing from the bond market, suggesting that there's perhaps worries about economic growth lying in the future. The likelihood of a recession is much higher and that's why market watchers are paying so much attention to this and getting spooked today.\nThat was Michelle Fleury and markets in Asia also opened sharply lower.\nA group of US Congress members have called on the Rwandan government to drop charges against Diane Rwigara, a government critic who's facing up to 22 years in prison on charges of incitement and fraud. She's due to be sentenced in Rwanda later today. Supporters say the charges are politically motivated and arose from Ms Rwigara's bid to run against President Paul Kagame in last year's elections.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n![](images/TheresaMay.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n我是斯图亚特·麦金托什，欢迎收听BBC新闻，大家好。\n英国首相特蕾莎·梅开启了一场为期五天的重要脱欧辩论，以此警告议会要么接受她的协议，要么无协议脱欧，要么不脱欧。\n不要让在座的人认为通过大喊大叫就能赢得一项更好的协议。不要幻想着否决了这份协议，就会有一份不同的协议奇迹般地出现。替代方案充满了不确定性和风险。所以今天我向你们保证，这是一份对英国民众来说最好的协议。 为了我们的人民和国家的最大利益，我请求你们支持这份协议。\n在辩论中，特蕾莎·梅表示欧盟没有时间也没有意愿在英国明年三月脱欧之前再次开启协商。\n美国特别顾问罗伯特·米勒表示特朗普的前国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林为俄罗斯干预美国大选的调查提供了实质性的帮助，因此他将面临短期刑期或零刑期。米勒正在带头调查俄罗斯干涉美国2016年总统大选一案。在周六的一份法庭文件中，罗伯特·米勒表示弗林提供了关于特朗普过渡团队和俄罗斯政府官员联系的一手资料。\n出于对经济衰退的担忧，美国股市暴跌。道琼斯工业平均指数达到了近三个月以来的最低点。所有的主要美国指数在交易日结束时都下降了3个百分点以上。\n我们看到所有的主要工业指数都下降了超过3个百分点。银行股票首当其冲，但是不仅仅是银行股票，运输业股票、工业股票、卡特彼勒和通用电气的股票都受到了影响。很多都和债券市场传递出的担忧和警告信号有关，这也暗示了人们对于未来经济增长的担忧。出现经济衰退的可能性变得更高，这也是为什么市场观察者今天如此关注该事件并感到惊慌的原因。\n以上是马歇尔·弗勒里的报道。亚洲市场开盘同样大幅下跌。\n美国国会议员呼吁卢旺达政府撤销对政府批判人士黛安·瑞嘉的指控，因煽动和诈骗指控，她将面临22年之久的刑期。今天晚些时候将在卢旺达进行宣判。支持者表示这些指控带有政治动机，且是由于瑞嘉去年与保罗·卡加梅竞选总统引起的。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News. The French government is abandoning plans to increase fuel taxes that prompted weeks of sometimes violent demonstrations. Four people died and hundreds were injured. After suspending the measure temporarily earlier this week, the Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has announced that it'll be dropped altogether from legislation on next year's budget. He said the government had to maintain peace. If the state is to remain strong and firm, it is first of all, the guarantor of public peace. To set the course and hold it is necessary in order to govern France. And as I said yesterday, no tax is worth putting the unity of the nation in danger.\nSerbia says it's considering military intervention as a possible response if its former province of Kosovo goes ahead with a plan to create its own army. President Aleksandar Vucic said the proposal was aimed at driving out Serbs still living in Kosovo.\nThe Liberian state energy company says about sixty percent of all electricity generated in the country is stolen. The theft is causing estimated losses of about thirty five million dollars a year as Warren Bull now reports. The Liberia energy corporation says large numbers of people are making illegal connections to their homes and businesses. Speaking to state radio, a spokesman said the theft was diverting cash that would have been used to improve power supplies to the west African country. Liberia is trying to rebuild an energy sector destroyed during a civil war which lasted from 1989 to 2003. The United States is giving financial and technical aid to increase connectivity as part of the Power Africa Initiative launched by the former US President Barrack Obama.\nBut the country still has one of the lowest access rates to energy in the world, only one in eight Liberians have electricity. There have been warm tributes to the former US President George H. W. Bush at his state funeral in the National Cathedral in Washington. Gary O'Donoghue was following the ceremony. With full pomp and ceremony, America paid tribute to its 41st President, a man who spent a lifetime in public service. George W. Bush, eldest son and 43rd President delivered the warmest of eulogies. But in America he leaves behind a country much changed since he controlled the levers of power, a country divided in ways that would have been anathema to his brand of politics. This is the latest world news from the BBC.\n![](images/bush-funeral.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼尔·努内斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。法国政府将放弃上涨燃油税的计划，该计划也激起了数周暴力时发的游行活动。已有四人死亡，数百人受伤。本周初该计划暂时中止之后，总理爱德华·菲利浦宣布上涨燃油税将从明年的预算法案中移除。他表示政府需要保持和平状态。如果法国要保持强大和稳固的话，首先它要保证治安。在治理法国方面，制定方向和稳固这一方向是必要的。正如我昨天所说的，没有一项税法可以不顾国家的统一。\n塞尔维亚称或考虑武力介入，如果原省份科索沃实施创建军队的计划。总统亚历山大·武契奇表示他们的计划是驱逐仍生活在科索沃的塞尔维亚人。\n利比里亚国家能源公司表示大约60%的国家电力被盗。偷电行为造成了大约每年3500万美元的损失，以下是沃伦·布尔的报道。利比里亚能源公司表示大量民众正在为其家庭和企业非法连接电网。一名发言人对国家广播说，偷电行为所转化的钱本应该用于为这个西非国家改善电力供应。利比里亚正在重建毁于1989年到2003年内战期间的电力部门。美国正在为利比里亚提升电网连接提供财力和技术支持，这也是由美国前总统巴拉克·奥巴马发起的非洲电力计划的一部分。\n但是该国仍然是世界上电网连通率最低的国家之一，只有八分之一的利比里亚人通上了电。美国前总统老布什的国葬在华盛顿的国家大教堂举行，人们向他表达了真挚的悼念。盖里·奥德诺霍正在对葬礼进行报道。在隆重的葬礼上，美国民众向第41任总统致以敬意，他将一生的时间都用在了公共事业上。他的大儿子，美国第43任总统小布什发表了最温暖的悼词。自从他掌控权利杠杆以来，他离开后的美国发生了很大变化，国家的分裂现状也正是他的执政理念所深恶痛绝的。BBC国际新闻。

        <title>BBC News - North-eastern Nigeria is littered with thousands of landmines</title>

            North-eastern Nigeria is littered with thousands of landmines and improvised explosives after almost a decade of conflict in the region.

        <markdown-content>North-eastern Nigeria is littered with thousands of landmines and improvised explosives after almost a decade of conflict in the region. The Islamist group Boko Haram continues to attack towns and villages and to kidnap hundreds of school girls, most notoriously from the town of Chibok in 2014. The number of people being killed and injured by mines and explosives in Nigeria has greatly increased according to research by the Mines Advisory Group (MAG). Over 160 killed in the past two years, with hundreds more injured. It's had a devastating impact on the region and prevents large areas of land from being farmed, and it's a familiar pattern across the globe.\nSo how many landmines are there around the world? Minefields are often the deadly remnants of war left behind long after the combatants have gone. Under international law when mines are laid they must be mapped so they can be removed safely at a later date. All too often they're not mapped or maps are lost and process of de-mining can be a slow and dangerous one. In 2016, post-conflict clearance operations undertaken by charities such as the Halo Trust destroyed over 200,000 anti-personnel and 20,000 anti-vehicle mines around the world. But this hardly scratches the surface of the problem. There are still an estimated 110 million anti-personnel mines still in the ground with more being laid every year in active conflict areas. In a single year as many as 8,000 people are killed or seriously injured many of them children. That's almost one person killed or injured every hour of every day. That figure has risen as a result of the widespread use of improvised explosive devices by non-government forces.\nBBC news.\n![](images/landmines.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n在尼日利亚东北部地区冲突停止几乎10年后，其地下仍然埋着上千的地雷和简易爆炸装置。而布下这些地雷和爆炸装置的伊斯兰组织“博科圣地”现在仍然在袭击城镇和乡村，并且因在2014年绑架了奇博克上百名学校女生而臭名远扬。根据地雷顾问团的调查，在尼日利亚，因为地雷和爆炸丧命和受伤的人数有了大幅的增长。在过去两年，尼日利亚超过160人因为地雷丧命，还有上百人因此受伤。地雷给尼日利亚东北部地区带来了灾难性的冲击，大面积地区受此影响不能耕种，全世界其他地区也都是类似的模式。\n那么在全世界地下埋着多少地雷？布雷区在参战方离开很久后，经常还是致命的战争遗留物。根据国际法，地雷在被布下后，必须在地图上标注，这样它们过后可以被安全移除。但是经常是，它们没有被标注或者地图遗失了，因此排雷的过程变得非常缓慢和危险。在2016年，像哈洛信托这样的慈善组织在后冲突地区进行了排雷行动，共摧毁全世界范围内的超过20万杀伤人员地雷和2万反载具地雷。但是这几乎没有解决问题。据估计，全世界的地下仍然埋着1.1亿杀伤人员地雷，并且在活跃的冲突地区每年还会布放新的地雷。单单一年，就有8000人因为地雷丧命或严重受伤，很多是儿童。这几乎相当于每天每小时就有一人因为地雷丧命或者受伤。这个数字还在增长，因为非政府武装力量现在广泛使用简易爆炸装置。

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is the BBC News with Fiona Macdonald. Court documents filed ahead of the sentencing of President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen have revealed new details about his contacts with Russia before the 2016 election. The memo from the Special Counsel Robert Mueller says Mr. Cohen met a trusted person in the Russian Federation. A separate document filed by federal prosecutors directly implicate President Trump in Michael Cohen's illegal payments to two women. Jon Sopel reports. These two filings could turn out to be a pivotal moment in Donald Trump's presidency. For the first time in a document from federal prosecutors, there's an accusation that in effect, Donald Trump broke the law during the presidential election campaign in buying the silence of two women who claimed to have had affairs with him. Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty to paying off the former porn star Stormy Daniels and a Playboy Model Karen McDougal in breach of Campaign Finance Laws. But the prosecutors say that he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1. Individual-1 in these court papers is the president.\nNearly 90,000 police are being deployed across France to counter a fourth weekend of protests by the "yellow vest" movement. Shops and metro stations have been closed in Paris. Lucy Williamson reports. Eight thousand security forces will be deployed in the capital, almost double that of last weekend. Another eighty thousand will be spread throughout France. They are expected to be more mobile than before and more proactive in tackling any threat. The government has said it expects extreme violence and that today's protesters include people who are coming explicitly to smash and it says to kill. The Interior Minister described the movement as a monster that was escaping its creators' control.\nA stampede at a nightclub in central Italy has killed at least six people. About a thousand people were in the venue in Corinaldo near Ancona, one of Italy's best-known rapper Sfera Ebbasta was performing at the club. Here's Caroline Rigby. What we're hearing is that people smelt a strong odor that they think might have been something like pepper spray. They fear that that might have been sprayed that caused people to panic inside, try and flee, trampling over each other according to officials and that caused a number of them to be crushed. We're hearing around a hundred have been injured, about ten of them seriously that they've been taken we understand to two nearby hospitals where the injured are being treated. You're listening to the world news from the BBC.\n![](images/nightclub.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，欢迎收听BBC新闻，我是菲奥娜·麦克唐纳德。在特朗普前律师迈克尔·科恩宣判之前，法庭公布的文件透露了他在2016年大选时与俄罗斯联系的新细节。特别顾问罗伯特·米勒的备忘录称科恩曾与一个“受信任”的俄罗斯联邦人士见过面。由联邦检察官发布的一份独立文件直接表明，特朗普与迈克尔·科恩向两名女性非法付款有关。以下是乔恩·苏博尔的报道。因这两个文件的发布，特朗普的总统生涯将会迎来一个关键节点。这是第一次在联邦检察官的文件中有对特朗普的指控，称他在总统竞选活动中花钱让两名女性保持沉默，这两名女性都声称与特朗普有染。迈克尔·科恩承认花钱买通前成人影星斯托米·丹尼尔斯和花花公子模特凯伦·麦克道戈，这违反了竞选金融法。但是检察官称他的行为是协同、并在“一号人物”的命令下实施的，法庭文件的一号人物指的是总统本人。\n法国部署了将近九万名警察，来对抗“黄马甲”运动人士第四周的抗议活动。巴黎的商店和地铁站都已关闭。以下是露西·威廉姆森的报道。八千名安全部队将会被部署在首都，几乎是上周人数的两倍，另外八万名警察将会分布在法国各地。预计他们在处理公共威胁方面将会更具机动性和主动性。政府表示将会迎来极度的暴力事件，今天的抗议人群中就有人明确表示是来破坏的，更有人称将会杀人。内政部长将这场运动称为洪水猛兽，现已脱离了其组织者的控制。\n意大利中部的一家夜店发生了一起踩踏事件，导致至少6人死亡。大约1000人聚集在安科纳市附近的科里纳尔多的一家场馆中，当时意大利一名非常出名饶舌歌手斯菲拉·伊博斯塔正在这家夜店表演。以下是卡罗兰·里戈比的报道。我们当时听到的是人们闻到了刺激的气味，他们认为应该是胡椒喷雾之类的东西。根据官方的消息，他们担心有人喷洒胡椒喷雾，造成了场馆内部人员的恐慌，人们仓皇失措四散逃离，造成了踩踏事件，并造成多人被踩伤。我们收到消息称现有100多人受伤，10人伤势严重，据我们所知伤者已被送往附近的两所医院接受治疗。您正在收听的是BBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Julie Candler with the BBC news. President Trump says his Chief of Staff John Kelly will leave his post at the end of the month. He told reporters he would decide on General Kelly's replacement within the next few days. A former Marine General with deep government know-how, John Kelly first served Mr. Trump as Homeland Security Secretary. As Chief of Staff, he was widely seen as bringing discipline to the White House. Here is Dan Johnson in Washington. The job of Chief of Staff is talked of as an important insider role, someone who can go into the Oval Office and tell the President the hard truth. So people are looking with interest for who Donald Trump will replace John Kelly with because he apparently was prepared to tell the President how it was. That's why their relationship has been fraught over the last eighteen months, why there have been occasions where apparently John Kelly was close to resigning.\nDelegates at a UN climate change conference in Poland have expressed dismay over the failure to welcome an international report on keeping the global rising temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath is at the conference. Here in Poland, efforts to welcome the report and recognize its significance quickly run into difficulties. Saudi Arabia, the US and Russia merely wanted to take note of the report. This dispute over words masks a deep row between countries that want rapid political action on cutting carbon and those who do not. As no acceptable compromise could be found, the text had to be dropped under UN rules. Many delegates were outraged by what they saw as a blatant attempt to weaken the science on climate change.\nSeveral women have come forward in Brazil to accuse an internationally known self-proclaimed spiritual healer of sexually abusing them. Joao Teixeira de Faria better known as Joao of God, has followers all over the world. Our America's editor Candace Piette has more details. On Brazil's Globo TV network, a Dutch woman Zahira Leeneke Maus accused Mr. Faria of manipulating her to perform sex acts and then raping her. Nine other Brazilian women who remained anonymous gave similar accounts. They say the abuse happened at Mr. Faria's spiritual clinic near Brasilia where he said to treat ten thousand people a month, many of them foreigners.

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is the BBC News with Fiona Macdonald.\nThe former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has been officially charged by Japanese prosecutors with underreporting his income by about 44 million dollars over a five-year period. He denies the allegation. Mr. Ghosn was one of the most high-profile car company bosses in the world. From Tokyo, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports.\nProsecutors have finally indicted Mr. Ghosn, accusing him of making misstatement on Nissan's annual securities reports. The indictment has come 22 days after Mr. Ghosn's arrest at Tokyo airport, and on the last day prosecutors could hold him without charge. In addition, this morning, the Japanese Securities and Exchange Commission asked prosecutors to indict Mr. Ghosn for suspected violations of financial rules. It's not clear whether this is a new and separate allegation.\nArmenia's acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has consolidated his authority with a landslide victory in a snap parliamentary election. He came to power in a peaceful revolution earlier this year and has promised to tackle corruption and reform Armenia's economy. Rayhan Demytrie reports.\nNikol Pashinyan's My Step coalition has received around 70% of total votes cast by Armenians in snap parliamentary elections. Two other parties passed the threshold and will be apportioned seats in parliament. But the former governing Republican Party is out. Early results suggest it picked up less than five percent of the vote, a stunning defeat after ruling Armenia for almost two decades. Mr. Pashinian will now have to begin the task of carrying out ambitious reforms to improve his country's economy and raise standards of living for ordinary Armenians.\nExit polls from the Peruvian referendum suggest the country is back the anti-corruption reforms of President Martin Vizcarra. Local media reporting that people have voted in favor of judicial reform, changes to campaign finance laws, and restrictions on the number of consecutive terms able to be served.\nThe French President Emmanuel Macron is due to meet trade unionists and business leaders following another weekend of violent anti-government protests in Paris and other cities. Mr. Macron has remained largely silent over the unrest. He scheduled to make an address to the nation later on Monday.\nThe European Court of Justice is to rule in the next few hours on whether the UK can unilaterally pull out of the process governing its withdrawal from the EU. Last week, a chief legal advisor to the court said Britain could do so without permission from other member states, as long as the decision followed a parliamentary vote, a general election or a referendum.\nBBC news.\n![](images/nissan-chairman.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，欢迎收听BBC新闻，我是菲奥娜·迈克唐纳德。\n日产汽车前会长卡洛斯·戈恩现已被日本检察官正式提起公诉，罪名是在5年期间内未如实上报其收入约四千四百万美元。他本人否认了这项指控。戈恩曾是世界最知名汽车公司的老板之一。以下是鲁珀特·温菲尔德-海耶斯的报道。\n检察官最终向戈恩提起了诉讼，指控他在日产的年度证券报告中造假。戈恩在东京机场被捕22天后检方对他提起了诉讼，那也是检方可以在不起诉他的情况下扣押他的最后一天。另外，今晨日本证券交易委员会要求检察官以涉嫌违反金融法规的罪名起诉戈恩。现尚不明确这是否是一个新的不同的指控。\n亚美尼亚代理总理尼科尔·帕希尼扬以压倒性优势取得了议会提前选举的胜利，巩固了他的政权。他在今年年初的一次和平革命中上台，承诺将会处理贪污腐败问题并改革亚美尼亚的经济。以下是瑞翰·迪米特里的报道。\n在议会提前选举中，尼科尔·帕希尼扬所在的“我的步伐”联盟获得了约70%的选票。另外两个政党得票通过最低门槛，并将在议会中获得席位。但是前执政党共和党却已出局。早期结果表明该政党的选票不足5%，这也是该党执政亚美尼亚近20年来最大的落败。帕希尼扬现在需要开始实施他宏大的改革计划，以改善本国的经济并提高普通亚美尼亚民众的生活水平。\n秘鲁公投后的民调显示本国民众支持马丁·比斯卡拉总统的反腐改革。当地媒体报道称人们支持司法改革、竞选金融法革新以及对连任次数进行限制。\n法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙将会见工会人士和商界领袖此前巴黎和其他城市周末再次爆发暴力反政府游行。马克龙在骚乱之后基本上都在保持沉默，他计划在周一发表全国演讲。\n欧洲法院将会在接下来的几个小时内裁定英国是否可以单方面退出脱欧进程。上周，欧洲法庭的一名首席法律顾问表示英国可以在不经过其他成员国的许可下退出，只要该决议通过议会投票、普选或是全民公投就行。\nBBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is Charles Carroll with the BBC News. The President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker has said there's no room whatsoever to renegotiate the Brexit deal that the British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to salvage. Mrs. May is on a tour of Europe to ask Mr. Juncker and her Dutch and German counterparts for assurances to try to convince sceptical British MPs to back the agreement. Earlier today, Mr. Juncker addressed the European Parliament. There is room if used intelligently, there is room enough to give further clarifications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement. This will not happen: everyone has to note that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened. Many British MPs fear the country could become permanently stuck in a legally binding backstop plan to avoid re-establishing a hard border in Ireland. Mrs. May canceled a parliamentary vote on her deal due to have taken place today and acknowledged that she would have been defeated.\nThe United Nations has launched a plan to support more than five and a half million refugees from Syria who are being hosted in neighboring countries. The organization is appealing for 5.5 billion dollars to help provide education and other services. Imogen Foulkes reports from Geneva. Since the Syrian conflict began, a million Syrian babies have been born in exile. A trickle of refugees around thirty seven thousand have returned home this year, and that could increase to a quarter of a million next year. But it's just a fraction of the estimated 5.6 million Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. Return is risky. Sporadic fighting continues.\nAt least ten people have been killed in an overnight attack by a rebel group in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Local officials say suspected members of the Allied Democratic Forces attacked the town of Oicha in the Beni region where they looted property and animals. The ADF which began as a Ugandan rebel group in the 1990s, has been blamed for hundreds of killings since 2014.\nA Franco-German meeting is underway in Paris to counter the smuggling of illegal firearms from the western Balkans. The French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that Europol estimated that up to six million firearms were in circulation in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Forty-four thousand illegal firearms had been destroyed there over the past year, he said, but that was not enough. He stressed the need for tighter checks on the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

        <markdown-content>I'm Stuart Mackintosh with the BBC News, hello.\nThe British Prime Minister Theresa May has survived a vote of no confidence in her leadership of the governing Conservative Party. The Party's Members of Parliament backed her by 200 votes to 117 in a secret ballot. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg has this assessment.\nThis was a clear result in favor of the Prime Minister, but also a clear picture of a party in conflicts and a result brokered only by a promise from Theresa May to go, if not just yet. She'll have now what a loyal minister described as a little more time. And yes Tory rules say that she can stay on undisturbed by the same kind of challenge for another twelve months. But while she is temporarily safer, Theresa May has less clout. A Prime Minister with a sell-by date holds less sway.\nPresident Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress and violating US Election Finance Laws. Nada Tawfik is at the court in New York.\nMichael Cohen hung his head and shook it in disbelief when the sentence was read. He was hoping for no jail time, but the judge ultimately imposed three years in prison. Substantial but still on the lower end of sentencing guidelines. The judge said that Michael Cohen had lost his moral compass and should have known better as a lawyer, and he said that no future cooperation could be taken into consideration in sentencing.\nFrance remains on its highest level of security alert as the search continues for a gunman who shot dead two people near a Christmas market in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The authorities have issued a photo of the suspect. The French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has announced the deployment of hundreds more soldiers across the country.\nAs of today, five hundred soldiers have been added to the force, and in the coming days, thirteen hundred will join those already mobilized. The objective is to secure sites open to the public, particularly Christmas markets.\nThe United States has warned Turkey against carrying out unilateral military action in northern Syria. The Pentagon said such a move would be of grave concern and could jeopardize US troops helping to fight the Islamic State group. The statement was issued after Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his forces would begin a military operation against a US-backed Kurdish militia in the region.\nYou're listening to the world news from the BBC News.\n![](images/conservative-party-vote.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n我是斯图亚特·麦金托什，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n英国首相特蕾莎·梅挺过执政党保守党对她领导能力的不信任投票。在无记名投票中，党内国会议员给她投了200个支持票和117个反对票。以下是我台劳拉·昆斯伯格的观点。\n对于首相来说这明显是一个有利的结果，但是这也清楚地表明了党内存在分歧，而这一结果的促成源于特蕾莎·梅离任的承诺，离去只是时间问题。正如一名拥护她的大臣所说，她现在又多了一些时间。按照保守党的规定，一年内不会对她发起不信任投票。尽管她暂时安全一些了，但是特蕾莎·梅的影响力已不如从前。一个被加上“保质期”的首相，其影响力也会下降。\n特朗普总统的前私人律师迈克尔·科恩因对国会说谎以及违反美国选举财务法被判刑三年。以下是那达·托菲克在纽约法庭的报道。\n当法官宣判时，迈克尔·科恩俯首摇头，不敢相信这样的结果。他本希望不会被判入狱，但是法官最终判了他三年的刑期。虽获刑，但也是按照量刑标准从轻宣判。法官表示迈克尔·科恩丧失了道德准则，身为律师知法犯法，法官还表示宣判结果没有商量的余地。\n法国仍处于最高级别的安全警戒状态，同时也在继续搜寻一名枪手，周二他在斯特拉斯堡的一家圣诞节市场附近枪杀了两人。政府已经发布了嫌犯的照片。法国总理爱德华·菲利普宣布在全国范围内再部署数百名士兵。\n截至今天，已有500名士兵加入武装力量，接下来的几天里还会有1300名士兵加入到队伍中。他们的任务就是保护开放的公共区域，尤其是圣诞节市场。\n美国警告土耳其不要在叙利亚北部发动单方面军事行动。五角大楼表示这样的举动将会引起严重关切，也会危害帮助与伊斯兰国组织战斗的美国的士兵的安全。在此声明发布之前，土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安曾表示他的军队将会对该区域内美国支持的库尔德民兵组织发动军事行动。\n您正在收听的是BBC新闻。

My parents, my brothers and sisters, I've sent them so many pictures and they don't believe it because for me this house is a place where I used to see in a movie, in an old English movie. The only reason that I left Syria and my brother who's two years older than me left was the government army, which we didn't want to join. We didn't want to hurt people, we didn't want to kill people.\nThat's not us. This is not what our religion taught us. I was hoping to come back in six months time. So, I was like: 'Mum I'm going to see you in six months time.' But here I am after seven years and I didn't see her. I started my journey through Turkey, Greece, the boat. Complete horror and just, just pure fear. We ended up in the Calais Jungle. The most horrendous place I've ever been in Europe. I've got to the UK, applied for asylum. I met this really nice lady who helped me when I was having trouble with accommodation and I met with the Chair and Trustee of this house, of Southside House. I have always felt lucky in this place. So mostly I work in the garden. I think they say I have green fingers. Green fingers? Is that right? I grew up in a very beautiful farm house with my parents, with animals. And I used to help my mum in the garden. My mum grew vegetables.\n![](images/english-house.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n我过去一年都住在这里，感觉自己太幸运了。我给我的父母还有兄弟姐妹发了很多照片，他们不相信我住在这，因为对我来说，这样的房子只存在于我过去常常看的电影里，英国老电影里。我离开了叙利亚，比我大两岁的哥哥也离开了，我们离开的唯一原因是因为政府军，我们不想加入政府军。我们不想伤害人，我们不想杀人。\n那不是我们想做的事。这不是我们的宗教教我们做的事。我当时希望六个月后就可以回去。所以当时想说：妈妈，我六个月后去看你。但是我在这里七年了，我没有去看她。我是从土耳其和希腊开始我的旅程的，做船。充满了恐怖，纯粹的恐惧。我们在加来丛林结束了旅程。那是我到欧洲后去过的最可怕的地方。我到了英国后，申请了避难。我遇到了这位非常善良的女士，她在我住宿遇到麻烦时帮助了我，我和这个房子——“南侧房”的主席兼受托人见了面。在这个房子里，我总是感觉很幸运。大部分时间我都在这个花园工作。我想他们说我有“绿手指”。绿手指？对吗？我在一个非常漂亮的农舍长大，还有父母和动物陪伴。我过去常常在菜园里帮我妈妈干活。我妈妈种菜。

        <markdown-content>BBC news. I'm John Shea. Tens of thousands of police have been deployed across France in preparation for the latest protests by the "yellow vests" movement. Paris has been shaken by some of the most serious rioting in decades over the last two weekends. Indications so far are that fewer people will join the demonstrations this week. Here's Hugh Schofield. After President Microns offered to open up the state's coffers on Monday, some in the "yellow vests" movement have acknowledged that that was a major step forward and they are calling for a pause. Others fear that the violence at the last two Saturday protests, much of it actually caused by young opportunists rather than bona fide protestors, is damaging the cause. But there are still "yellow vests" surround the country who feel that now is not the time to ease up the pressure. They feel that if Macron has given once he can give again.\nThe UN climate conference in Poland has been extended to allow negotiators more time to finalize a deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The talks continued through the night on contentious issues, including how poor countries should be compensated for the damage caused by global warming.\nMahinda Rajapaksa has announced his resignation as Sri Lanka's prime minister. In a statement, he said he had no intention of continuing in the post without a general election being held. With the details here's Anbarasan Ethirajan. Mahinda Rajapaksa who strongly believes in astrology, signed his resignation letter in an auspicious time during a religious ceremony held at his home in Colombo. He was controversially appointed two months ago by President Maithripala Sirisena to replace Ranil Wickremesinghe, triggering a political crisis in Sri Lanka. But he failed to command a majority in Parliament and a court also restrained him from acting as Prime Minister. In a statement, Mr. Rajapaksa said his resignation would make way for the president to form a new government. There are suggestions that Mr. Rajapaksa's resignation could lead to Mr. Wickremasinghe returning to power on Sunday.\nThe Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said his country now recognizes West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But in a speech in Sydney, Mr. Morrison said the Australian embassy would not be relocated from Tel Aviv until the final status of Jerusalem was resolved. He said the decision took him to account the interests of both sides. Australia now recognizes West Jerusalem, being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel.

        <markdown-content>BBC News. I'm John Shea. Environmental groups and some countries have criticized Saturday's agreement at the UN climate conference in Poland as lacking in ambition. The deal sought to lay down the rules to implement the 2015 Paris accord. David Shookman has this assessment. Applause and relief in Katowice mask some difficult questions about this latest deal. Under the new rules, countries are expected to publish their plans for cutting their emissions of greenhouse gases. But the Paris Agreement is voluntary, so no government is under any obligation. And even if every country takes the steps that they've promised to, the world will still be on course for what scientists consider dangerous levels of warming. But critics point to the most recent assessment by the UN climate panel, which concluded that emissions must start falling in the next twelve years.\nSri Lanka's ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has been sworn back into office nearly two months after he was sacked by President Maithripala Sirisena. The move plunged Sri Lanka into a political crisis which saw Mr. Wickremasinghe replaced by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, but he's faced political and legal setbacks as Charles Haviland reports. Mr. Wickremasinghe's return to office is likely to end seven weeks of constitutional chaos. In October, his uneasy political ally President Sirisena tried to boot him out and replace him with Mahinda Rajapaksa, the hard-line nationalist ex-president. Mr. Sirisena also tried to dissolve Parliament, but on Thursday the Supreme Court deemed that action illegal. The crisis has rocked a country still grappling with an ugly pattern of human rights abuses during its long ethnic war.\nThe head of the Pakistani Army has approved death sentences for fifteen people convicted by military courts of involvement in Islamic attacks. Twenty other militants were given prison sentences. This report from Charish Haney. The confirmation of the death sentences comes as Pakistan marks the fourth anniversary of an attack on an army-run school in Peshawar in which more than a hundred and fifty people were killed. The attack prompted Pakistan to lift a six-year moratorium on executions, and hundreds are reported to have been put to death since then. The fifteen who had their death sentences confirmed could appeal. Rights groups say military trials are unfair, but the authorities insist they have no choice in a country ravaged by militancy. BBC News.\n![](images/ranil-wickremasinghe.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，我是约翰·席亚。环境保护组织和一些国家批评了波兰联合国气候大会达成的协议，称其缺乏“雄心壮志”。该协议旨在制定规定来落实2015年的《巴黎协定》，以下是大卫·舒克曼的报道。在卡兹委托会议的掌声和欣慰的掩盖之下，这项最新的协议还有很多棘手的问题。在新的规定之下，各国应该公开削减温室气体排放的计划。但是《巴黎协定》是自愿性质的，所以谈不上义务。即使每个国家都按照承诺采取了措施，世界还是会继续升温到科学家所认为的危险水平。但批评人士指向了联合国气候小组近期的评估，该评估称碳排放必须在接下来的12年内开始下降。\n斯里兰卡被罢黜的总理拉尼尔·维克勒马辛哈重新宣誓就职，近两个月之前，他被总统迈特里帕拉·西里塞纳解雇。维克勒马辛哈被前总统拉贾帕克萨替代时，还引起了斯里兰卡的一次政治危机，但是后者遇到了政治和法律上挫折。以下是查尔斯·哈维兰的报道。维克勒马辛哈重新上任有可能会结束七周的宪法危机。然而在十月份，他的政治盟友，总统西里塞纳曾解雇他，并让强硬派民族主义者，前总统马欣达·拉贾帕克萨就职。西里塞纳同样想解散国会，但是周二最高法院认为此举不合法。该危机震动了斯里兰卡，然而这个国家还没有摆脱其漫长民族战争中丑陋的侵犯人权问题。\n巴基斯坦军领导人批准了15人死刑判决，军事法庭判处他们有罪，他们参与了伊斯兰袭击。另外20名武装分子被判服刑，以下是查理士·汉尼的报道。死刑判决确认的同时正值四周年纪念，白沙瓦一所军营学校四年前遭袭，当时有150多人被杀。该袭击促使巴基斯坦取消了6年死刑缓刑制度，据报道已有数百人被执行死刑。被确认死刑判决的这15人可以上诉。人权组织表示军事宣判是不公平的，但是政府表示在一个武装分子肆虐的国家这也是不得已的选择。BBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News.\nFighting has erupted again around the Yemeni port of Hodeida after a United Nations-brokered ceasefire failed to take hold. Houthi rebels and the Saudi-backed government had agreed to halt the violence at talks in Sweden last week, but government officials accused the Iranian-backed Houthis of shelling government troops east of Hodeidah just minutes after the truce came into force.\nA court in El Salvador has freed a woman who spent a year and seven months in jail accused of trying to abort her baby. The 20-year-old woman Imelda Cortez said that she became pregnant by her stepfather who sexually abused her for many years. Leonardo Rocha has more details.\nImelda Cortez said that she began being sexually abused by her stepfather when she was 12 and in April last year she gave birth to a baby. She says the baby is from her stepfather who's now in his seventies. Doctors in El Salvador, they accuse her of trying to terminate the pregnancy, which in El Salvador amounts to a charge of attempted murder.\nThe family of a dying two-year-old boy in California say his Yemeni mother is being prevented from visiting him by the Trump administration's travel ban on visitors from seven mainly Muslim countries. Doctors say Abdullah Hassan is terminally ill with a brain disease. The boy's father, whose was born in California, brought him to the US. Saad Sweilem is from the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\nThey've been actually waiting for over a year to try to get her to be able to come here. Just a few months ago, they finally realized, you know we can't wait much longer. So the father went ahead and brought Abdullah here to the US in hopes that he'd get medical treatment and in the meantime, his wife would be able to get her visa situation ratified and become joined them. But instead it's taken a turn for the worst and now we find her son Abdullah here and his mother unable to come be by his side.\nA judge in the US state of Missouri has ordered a convicted deer poacher to watch repeat screenings of the Walt Disney film Bambi as part of his sentence. Generations of children and adults have been reduced to tears by the carton film of Bambi released in 1942 in which the young fawn's mother is killed by a hunter. Here's Anthony Zahra.\nA judge in Missouri has sentenced David Berry Jr. to watch the film once a month during a year-long jail sentence. Berry has been convicted of illegally killing hundreds of deer and taking their heads for trophies. Officials said it was one of their largest-ever poaching investigations.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n![](images/salvador.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼尔·努内斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n联合国斡旋下的停火协议未能实现，也门港口城市荷台达再起战火，上周瑞典会谈时，胡塞武装和沙特支持的政府军同意停止暴力，但是政府官员指责伊朗支持的胡塞叛军在荷台达东部向政府军开炮，而此时距离停火协议生效仅几分钟。\n萨尔瓦多的一家法庭释放了一名因意图堕胎而入狱一年零七个月的女性。这名20岁的女性名为伊美黛·科特兹，她表示自己被其继父性侵多年，最终导致怀孕。以下是莱昂纳多·罗查的详细报道。\n伊美黛·科特兹表示她从12岁开始被其继父性侵，并在去年4月生下一名婴儿。她表示孩子是她继父的，而他现已70多岁。萨尔瓦多医生指控她意图终止妊娠，而这在萨尔瓦多被认为是谋杀未遂。\n在美国加州，一名生命垂危的两岁男孩的家人称他在也门的妈妈因特朗普政府对7个主要穆斯林国家的旅行禁令而不能来到他的身边。医生表示阿卜杜拉·哈桑患脑疾且生命垂危。男孩的父亲出生在加州，他将男孩带到了美国。以下是美国伊斯兰关系理事会的萨德·斯韦勒姆的讲话。\n实际上他们已经等了一年多想让孩子的母亲来到美国。几个月之前，他们最终意识到已经不能再等了。于是父亲先带着阿卜杜拉来到了美国，希望他能得到治疗，同时也希望妻子的签证获批从而和他们团聚。但现在男孩的病情恶化，我们看到病床上的阿卜杜拉而他的母亲却无法来到他的身边。\n美国密苏里州的一名法官下令一名小鹿偷猎者反复观看迪士尼影片《小鹿斑比》，并将此作为他判刑的一部分。几代人，不论大人还是小孩都被这部1942年上映动画片《小鹿斑比》感动地流下了眼泪，影片中小鹿的妈妈被猎人猎杀。以下是安东尼·扎赫拉的报道。\n密苏里州的一名法官判处小大卫·贝里有期徒刑一年，并在此期间内每月观看这部影片一次。贝里因非法猎杀数百头鹿并取下鹿头作为战利品而被判刑。相关官员表示这是该州有史以来调查的最大偷猎案件之一。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm David Harper with the BBC News. New York's Attorney General has held the closure of the charity established in President Trump's name as a victory for the rule of law. Barbara Underwood, who is a Democrat, accused the Trump Foundation of engaging in a shocking pattern of illegality. Our north American editor Jon Sopel has more details on the charity. Far from this being a vehicle for giving and philanthropy, the New York Attorney General has described in the most scathing terms how the Trumps were using this for their own purposes. There was a shocking pattern of illegality, including unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign. Repeated and willful self-dealing, this amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests. Trump's attorneys said those accusations were inaccurate and politicized.\nA judge in the United States has delayed the sentencing of President Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn to give more time for him to cooperate with prosecutors. The judge was fiercely critical of Mr. Flynn, saying it could be argued that he sold out his country. Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the US. At a briefing, the White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders expressed the administration's support for Mr. Flynn. The delay is something between General Flynn and the courts, and that's something for them to determine what timeline looks like. In the meantime, we wish General Flynn well, and we'll continue to focus on doing what we do here every single day.\nThe Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has offered his resignation following the withdrawal earlier this month of one of the partners in his governing coalition. Kevin Connolly reports from Brussels. Charles Michel, a French-speaking liberal, has been in government with the conservative movement of Flemish-speaking nationalists, the NVA. When that coalition collapsed last week cause of NVA's rejections to Mr. Michel's decision to agree to the new UN declaration on migration, it left Mr. Michel out on a limb. His resignation is now held in suspension, leaving him as a kind of caretaker Prime Minister. Somehow, Mr. Michel now has to find a way to pass a federal budget. If he can't, the country will edge closer to political crisis. Kevin Connolly reporting from Brussels.\nHuman Rights Watch has called on the authorities in Mali to prosecute militia members and their leaders, saying attacks in the center of the country are spiraling out of control.

        <title>BBC News - Japan has decided to withdraw from the IWC in order to resume whaling on a commercial basis</title>
        <description>
            In September, Japan launched a controversial bid to ease the moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the IWC more than thirty years ago. But its argument that whale stocks has recovered sufficiently to justify the resumption of sustainable hunting was voted down. That seems to have paved the way for this decision. According to the Kyoto News Agency, Tokyo would only allow whaling in the seas around Japan and not stray into Antarctic waters.

        <markdown-content>BBC News. Hello, I'm Gareth Barlow.\nSenators in the United States, including high-profile Republicans, have condemned President Trump's announcement that he's withdrawing American forces from Syria. Six senators led by the Republican Lindsey Graham have written to Mr. Trump, accusing him of making a costly mistake that threatened US security.\nEarlier, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said the move was completely unexpected. We've got allies around the world that have been with us all this time, have been fighting with us. There's probably fifty or sixty countries that have been involved in some form of fashion. To my knowledge, we didn't even communicate with them that this morning we were gonna make this announcement. It's caught everybody off guard. I know that, I doubt there's anybody in the Republican Caucus in the Senate that just isn't stunned.\nBritain, a major ally of the US has expressed concern and questioned Mr. Trump's assertion that Islamic State militants in Syria had been defeated. The British Defense Minister Tobias Ellwood said that on the contrary, the threat from IS was very much alive.\nJapanese government sources say the country has decided to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission in order to resume whaling on a commercial basis. The BBC's Cat Wiener has more details.\nIn September, Japan launched a controversial bid to ease the moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the IWC more than thirty years ago. But its argument that whale stocks has recovered sufficiently to justify the resumption of sustainable hunting was voted down. That seems to have paved the way for this decision. According to the Kyoto News Agency, Tokyo would only allow whaling in the seas around Japan and not stray into Antarctic waters.\nMeanwhile, a court in Japan has rejected a request by prosecutors to extend the detention of Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan who was sacked for alleged financial misconduct. The ruling means he could soon be released. With the details, Steve Jackson reports.\nCarlos Ghosn was first detained on the nineteenth of November when his private jet landed in Tokyo. The 64-year-old French-Brazilian was one of the world's most powerful auto industry executives, but has spent the past month in prison. During that time, he's been charged with lying about his pay for several years. He's accused of hiding eighty million dollars of income and of misusing company funds. He denies all the allegations. The timing of his release is unclear, but Japanese media say it could happen as soon as Friday. The court also rejected an extension to the detention of Greg Kelly, an aide to Mr. Ghosn.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n![](images/withdraw-forces-from-syria.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，大家好，我是加雷斯·巴罗。\n包括知名共和党人在内的美国议员对特朗普宣布从叙利亚撤军进行了谴责。以共和党人林赛·格雷厄姆为首的六名议员致信特朗普，指责他犯了一个代价高昂的错误，威胁到了美国的安全。\n早前，参议院外交关系委员会主席鲍勃·考克尔曾表示此举完全出人意料。一直以来，我们的盟友遍布世界各地。他们一直与我们并肩战斗。美国在全世界大约有50到60个这样的盟国。据我所知，我们甚至没有和他们沟通过，他们不知道今晨我们会做出这样的决定。这让每个人都措手不及，我知道，恐怕参议院共和党核心小组内没人不对此感到震惊。\n作为美国的一个重要盟友，英国也对此表示关切，并质疑了特朗普关于叙利亚境内伊斯兰国军事力量已被击败的声明。英国国防部长托比亚斯·埃尔伍德表示，与特朗普所言相反，伊斯兰国组织的威胁依旧很大。\n日本政府消息称日本已决定退出国际捕鲸协会，以恢复商业捕鲸业。以下是BBC记者卡特·温纳的详细报道。\n九月，日本发起了一项具有争议的恢复商业捕鲸提议，要求解除30多年前IWC强制实行的商业捕鲸禁令。日本辩称鲸鱼的数量现已充分恢复可以重新开始持续捕鲸，但遭到否决。这似乎给日本恢复捕鲸的决定铺平了道路。京都新闻社报道称，日本将只允许在日本周边海域捕鲸，并不进入大西洋海域。\n同时，日本一法庭拒绝了检方要求延长日产前董事长卡洛斯·戈恩羁押期的要求，不久前卡洛斯因所谓的财政不当行为遭解雇。法庭的裁定意味着他可能在不久之后会被释放。以下是史蒂夫·杰克森的详细报道。\n卡洛斯·戈恩首次在11月19日被拘押，当时他的私人飞机落地东京。这名64岁的法裔巴西人曾是世界上最强汽车企业高管之一，但是过去半个月却在狱中度过。在此期间，他被指控在多年的薪资问题上说谎。他被指控隐报了八千万美元的收入并挪用了公司的资金。他否认了所有指控。他的释放日期尚不清楚，但是日本媒体称最早周五就会被释放。该法庭也拒绝延长戈恩助手格蕾格·凯利的羁押期。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <title>BBC News - The capacity to survive is an inherent inborn talent or a function of learning certain behavioural tactics?</title>
        <description>
            Hayes was a very successful stock trader on the New York stock exchange. He believed that the capacity to survive and to do well is an inherent inborn talent. He would argue he could be a survivor anywhere. I spent my life in the woods, hunting and fishing. I argue on the other hand that survival is more a function of learning certain behavioural tactics to get by, and that they are environmentally specific.

        <markdown-content>Hayes was a very successful stock trader on the New York stock exchange. He believed that the capacity to survive and to do well is an inherent inborn talent. He would argue he could be a survivor anywhere. I spent my life in the woods, hunting and fishing. I argue on the other hand that survival is more a function of learning certain behavioural tactics to get by, and that they are environmentally specific. And I said to Hayes 'If you come up to New Hampshire and went out in the woods with me, you wouldn't have a chance.'\nA friend of mine sent me sent me a catalogue that had in it a pistol, and it shot a little ball of paint about this big round, and it was used by foresters to mark trees to be cut down and so forth. And I have one of those eureka moments. Two things come together. I called Hayes up, and said 'I've figured out how we are going to prove this argument one way or another.' So I ordered two of these guns, and a bunch of the pellets, and Hayes came up to my house. We decided we'd test these guns out because as far as we'd known, nobody had ever shot a person with them. Hayes shot first, and he missed, and I shout him right it in the butt. And it hurt! So then what we did, we went out into forty acres of woods and Hayes went in one end, I went in the other, and we hunted each other. Within about 20 minutes I came around a big maple tree, and Hayes was sitting on a rock, and I walked right up behind him, and put the barrel of the gun right on his neck, and said 'alright, I don't want to shoot you, who wins?!'\n**参考译文：**\n海斯是纽约证券交易所一位很成功的证券交易人。他相信生存的能力和生存的好的能力是一种内在的天生的才华。他认为他在哪里都能生存。我一辈子都生活在树林里，打猎和钓鱼。我则认为生存更多是学习某些行为策略来存活的能力，这些策略和特定环境有关。我对海斯说：“如果你来新罕布什尔州，和我一起去树林里，你不会有机会的。”\n我的一个朋友给我寄了一个产品样品，里面是一个手枪，它会射出这么大这么圆的彩色的小球，这种小球是森林作业者用来标记要砍的树和干其他事情。然后我就有了灵感。两件事连一起了。我给海斯打了电话说：“不管怎么做，我已经知道了证明这场争论谁对谁错的办法。”然后我订购了两把这样的手枪和一把这样的小球，海斯来到了我家。我们决定测试下这些枪，因为据我们所知，还没有人用它来射人。海斯先射的，射歪了，我直接射到他屁股上了。他感觉疼！后来我们做的事就是我们去了一个占地四十英亩的树林里，海斯去了一边，我去了另一边，我们互相猎杀对方。不到20分钟，我绕到了一颗大枫树边，海斯那时坐在一块石头上，我径直走到他后面，把枪管正架在他脖子上说：“好吧，我不想射你，谁赢了？！”

        <markdown-content>This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Jonathan Izard. Police in Britain are questioning a man and a woman who have been detained on suspicion of involvement in the illegal use of drones near Gatwick, the country's second biggest airport.Passengers are being warned of further disruption because of a backlog caused by the cancellation or diversion of about a thousand flights. Jenny Kumah is in Gatwick with the latest. They have made two arrests in connection with that criminal drone activity and they say that proactive investigations are still ongoing and they're asking the public to contact them if they have any further information. It's very busy here, lots of people making that Christmas getaway, but there are delays. The airport is hoping to run around seven hundred and fifty flights today. We know that already six have been cancelled and there are some delays on other services.\nTwo explosions in the Somali capital Mogadishu have killed at least a dozen people, including a prominent television journalist. Awil Dahir Salad was travelling in his car with other employees at the station Universal TV who were also killed. Mercy Juma reports from Nairobi. The first car bomb went off at a checkpoint near the presidential palace in Mogadishu. The second explosion took place just minutes after, covering huge parts of the capital in smoke. Police say politicians and other officials were near the site of the blasts. One of the injured is the deputy governor of Barnard region. Images circulating on social media show destroyed vehicles in debris littering the streets. Islam's terrorist group al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the twin blasts which have shattered nearly a month of calm in Mogadishu. a town there is often the target of attacks by al-Shabaab.\nA sixth consecutive Saturday of protests by the yellow vests movement is beginning in France. In Paris which has seen violence in recent weekends, some demonstrators gathered Montmartre and in the centre of the city. The anti-government protests started over planned rises on fuel taxes but also focus on wider living standards. This protester called on President Macron to deal with the high cost of living. The government doesn't want to help all its citizens get out of penury, help them live a dignified life, dignified, because the salaries, salaries must be salaries. You can't live on them, stop with your one hundred euros, two hundred euros. It's nothing. It's nothing. The cost of living is way up high. Bring it down so that France can succeed. A tenth person has died linked to the demonstrations after a driver crashed into the back of a lorry at a yellow vest roadblock near the southern city of Perpignan. This is the world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，大家好，我是乔纳森·伊泽德。英国警方正在审问一名男子和一名女子，他们因涉嫌在英国第二大的机场盖特威克机场附近非法使用无人机被捕。旅客受到警告航班将会进一步中断，因为约一千架次航班被取消或者转移导致旅客滞留。以下是简妮·库玛的报道。警方已经抓捕了两名与非法操纵无人机有关的嫌犯，他们还表示主动调查正在进行中，他们还要求了解更多信息的公众与他们联系。机场十分忙碌，很多人都在进行圣诞旅行，但是碰到了航班延迟。机场希望今天可以飞750架航班。我们了解到已经有六架次被取消，还有一些其他服务的延迟。\n索马里首都摩加迪沙的爆炸导致至少十二人死亡，其中就包括一名知名的电视节目记者。阿维尔·达希尔·萨拉德当时正与环球电视台的其他员工乘车经过这里，他们也都不幸遇难。以下麦茜·祝马在内罗毕的报道。第一枚汽车炸弹在摩加迪沙总统官邸附近的检查点爆炸，第二枚也在几分钟后爆炸，爆炸引起的烟雾覆盖了首都的大面积区域。警方称政界人士和一些官员当时正在爆炸区域附近。受伤的人群中就包括巴纳德区的副区长。社交网络的传出的图片显示汽车碎片散落在街上。伊斯兰恐怖组织索马里青年党宣称对这两次袭击负责，袭击打破了摩加迪沙一个月以来的平静局面，该镇经常遭到青年党的袭击。\n法国连续第七个周六的“黄马甲”抗议活动开始了。在最近的周末，巴黎发生了不少暴力活动，游行者聚集在蒙马特尔以及城市中心地区。反政府抗议者以计划汽油税上涨为由发动游行活动，但是他们同样关注的是生活水平的巨大差异。抗议者要求总统马克龙处理生活成本过高的问题。政府并不想帮助所有民众摆脱贫困，或是帮他们过上有尊严的生活，人们的薪资必须是实实在在的薪资。而现在的工资已不足维持生活，一两百欧元的薪资根本微不足道。生活成本现在变得太高，只有下调才能让法国变得强大。由游行导致的第十起死亡事故发生，在法国南部城市佩皮尼昂的黄马甲路障附近，一名司机与一辆货车追尾。BBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm David Harper with the BBC News.\nIndonesia official said at least 43 people were killed when a tsunami struck several beaches around the Sunda Strait, the stretch of water that separates the islands of Java and Sumatra. The Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly six hundred people were injured and others are still missing. Emergency services are yet to arrive in the affected area. Rebecca Henschke reports from Jakarta. We're getting clearer images now of those beach towns along the coast of West Java that face onto the Sunda Strait, images of crumbled buildings along the coast there. We've also seen images from last night of these wave rushing into hotels. We are also hearing about devastation on the other side Sumatra, Lampung with some areas officials say they haven't been able to contact. So they're warning that the death toll is very much likely to rise as they continue to get more information about what happened last night.\nEmperor Akihito of Japan has broadcast his last birthday message before he steps down next April. The emperor who turned eighty-five on Sunday appeared to be overcome with emotion when he thanked the people of Japan and Empress Michiko for having supported him throughout his life on the throne. Now my journey as emperor is reaching the end. I am grateful for the many people in Japan who have accepted my status as a symbol and supported me. And I would like to also express my appreciation to the empress, who was a Japanese citizen who joined me in my life journey and for sixty long years has devoted herself to her role and the people of Japan with sincerity. The emperor said he was relieved that his reign was ending without Japan having again been engaged in a war. He expressed his hopes for the new era to start when Crown Prince Naruhito ascends the throne.\nTens of thousands of people have marched in the Serbian capital Belgrade for the third consecutive weekend to protest against what they say is the president's increasingly autocratic rule.

There were chaotic scenes in the Senate Chamber in Rome when opposition members demanded to see a draft text of the bill. Italy's anti-austerity coalition government has amended the document after the European Commission said it would breach the block's fiscal rules.

        <markdown-content>**Run through the rain**\n**雨中的记忆**\nShe had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful brown haired, freckle-faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the Earth, it has no time to flow down the spout.\n她和妈妈刚在沃尔玛结束购物。这个天真的小女孩应该6岁大了，头发是美丽的棕色，脸上有雀斑。外面下着倾盆大雨。雨水溢满了檐槽，来不及排走，就迫不及待地涌涨上地面。\nWe all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart. We all waited, some patiently, others irritated, because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I get lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child come pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day.\n我们都站在沃尔玛门口的遮篷下。大家都在等待，有人很耐心，有人很烦躁，因为老天在给他们本已忙碌的一天添乱。雨天总引起我的遐思。我出神地听着、看着老天冲刷洗涤这世界的污垢和尘埃，孩时无忧无虑地在雨中奔跑玩水的记忆汹涌而至，暂时缓解了我一天的焦虑。\nHer voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in, “Mom, let's run through the rain." she said.\n小女孩甜美的声音打破了这令人昏昏欲睡的气氛，“妈妈，我们在雨里跑吧。”她说。\nWhat? Mom asked.\n“什么？”母亲问。\nLet's run through the rain! She repeated.\n“我们在雨里跑吧，”她重复。\nNo, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit. Mom replied.\n“不，亲爱的，我们等雨小一点再走。”母亲回答说。\nThis young child waited about another minute and repeated: "Mom, let's run through the rain."\n过了一会小女孩又说：“妈妈，我们跑出去吧。”\nWe'll get soaked if we do. Mom said.\n“这样的话我们会湿透的。”母亲说。\nNo, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning, the girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm."\n“不会的，妈妈。你今天早上不是这样说的。”小女孩一边说一边拉着母亲的手。\nThis morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?\n“今天早上？我什么时候说过我们淋雨不会湿啊？”\nDon't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, If God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!\n“你不记得了吗？你和爸爸谈他的癌症时，你不是说‘如果上帝让我们闯过这一关，那我们就没有什么过不去。’”\nThe entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear you couldn't hear anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in the next few minutes. Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say.\n人群一片寂静。我发誓，除了雨声，你什么都听不到。我们都静静地站着。接下来的几分钟没有一个人走动。母亲停了一下，想着应该说些什么。\nNow some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a young child's life. Time when innocent trust can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith. "Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If get wet, well maybe we just needed washing." Mom said. Then off they ran.\n有人也许会对此一笑了之，或者责备这孩子的不懂事，有人甚至不把她的话放在心上。但这却是一个小孩子一生中需要被肯定的时候。若受到鼓舞，此时孩子单纯的信任就会发展成为坚定的信念。“亲爱的，你说得对，我们跑过去吧。如果淋湿了，那也许是因为我们的确需要冲洗一下了。”母亲说。然后她们就冲出去了。\nWe all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they darted past the cars and. They held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked. But they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars. And yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing.Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away your precious memories. So, don't forget to make time and take the opportunities to make memories every day!\n我们站在那里，笑着看她们飞快地跑过停着的汽车。她们把购物袋高举过头想挡挡雨，但还是湿透了。好几个人像孩子般尖叫着，大笑着，也跟着冲了出去，奔向自己的车子。当然，我也这样做了，跑了出去，淋湿了。我也需要接受洗礼。环境或其他人可以夺去你的物质财富，抢走你的金钱，带走你的健康，但没有人可以带走你珍贵的回忆。因此，记得要抓紧时间，抓住机会每天都给自己留下一些回忆吧！\nTo everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven. I hope you still take the time to run through the rain.\n世间万物皆有自己的季节，做任何事情也有一个恰当的时机。希望你有机会在雨中狂奔一回。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News.\nThe Iranian President has told Parliament his country has missed an opportunity to exploit the United States international isolation. Hassan Rouhani spoke as he presented a forty-seven-billion-dollar budget, the first such measure since the reintroduction of US sanctions on Iran. Shihab Mosbut has this report.\nIn a rowdy and often interrupted address, President Hassan Rouhani said corruption and nepotism at the highest levels of society meant Iran had failed to take advantage of American isolationism. He said the reform with banking, tax and economic infrastructure were essential before Iran could advance its cause internationally. Iran, he said, must harness the strength of its oil industry to counter America sanctions.\nThe British government has confirmed that a British-Iranian academic who has spent eight months in jail in Iran has been released. Abbas Edalat, who is a professor of computer science and mathematics, has returned to the UK. He was arrested by Iran's revolutionary guards in Tehran in April. An Iranian news agency alleged at the time that he was a British spy.\nPresident Erdogan of Turkey has invited Donald Trump to visit next year as the two men attempt to coordinate a pullout of US troops from Syria. Key Middle Eastern powers are seeking to capitalize on America's withdrawal from Syria. Sebastian Usher assesses the situation on the ground.\nThe Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is biding his time, but remains clear in his determination to force Kurdish militias out of Northern Syria. On the ground, militias once united and rebellion now ally to Turkey are reported to have deployed closer to the town of Manbij, while more Turkish troops have moved to the Syrian border in recent days. US soldiers are still in Manbij for now in support of a Kurdish-led alliance they've backed in the battle against IS. The Kurdish fighters were meant to have withdrawn under a deal agreed between the US and Turkey but have yet to leave. President Erdogan says he won't strike against them until the US pulls out.\nTrade unions and professional associations in Sudan have called for a general strike today to demand the resignation of President al-Bashir and the formation of a transitional government. They are planning a march to the presidential palace in Khartoum. Doctors went on strike on Monday as part of the protests sparked last week by anger about the rising price of bread and fuel. On Monday, President Bashir promised what he called real reforms to improve the quality of life of the Sudanese people.\nThis is the world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼尔·努内斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n伊朗总统告诉国会，伊朗错过了利用美国国际孤立政策的机会。哈桑·鲁哈尼发表讲话的同时提交了一份470亿美元的预算，这是美国重新对伊朗实施制裁之后伊朗发布的首项措施。以下是什哈卜·莫斯巴特的报道。\n在环境喧闹并多次被打断的讲话中，哈桑·鲁哈尼总统表示社会最高层的腐败和裙带关系表明伊朗没能利用好美国的孤立政策。他表示在伊朗向国际化推进之前，对银行、税收和经济结构进行改革是必要的。他还表示伊朗必须要利用其石油产业的优势以对抗美国的制裁。\n英国政府已确认一名在伊朗监狱中度过8个月的英国籍伊朗学者现已被释放。阿巴斯·艾德勒是一名计算机科学和数学教授，他现在已经返回英国。他于四月在德黑兰被伊朗革命卫队逮捕。当时一家伊朗新闻机构称他是一名英国间谍。\n土耳其总统埃尔多安邀请了特朗普明年来访，两人计划共同协调美国从叙利亚撤军相关事宜。中东地区的主要力量都寻求利用美国从叙利亚撤军这一机会。以下是塞巴斯汀·厄舍对该事件的实地报道。\n土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安正在耐心等待，但是对于将库尔德武装赶出叙利亚北部的决心十分明确。在当地，据报道之前联合起来的民兵组织以及现在和土耳其结盟的反对派武装都在向曼比杰靠近，而近些天以来也有更多的土耳其军队向叙利亚边境移动。美国士兵仍在曼比杰支持库尔德领导的武装联盟，在与IS的战斗他们支持该武装联盟。库尔德武装本应该按照美国和土耳其的协议从该地区撤出，但仍未离开。埃尔多安总统表示在美国撤军之前不会向他们开火。\n苏丹工会和专业协会今天号召民众举行了一次大罢工，以要求巴希尔总统辞职并组建过渡政府。他们计划在位于喀土穆的总统官邸游行。上周因面包和燃料价格上涨引发了愤怒的游行活动，周一医生们也加入到了罢工中来。周一，总统巴希尔承诺将进行所谓的实质性改革以改善苏丹人民的生活质量。\nBBC国际新闻。

            Reports from Italy say ten people have been injured following an earthquake in the area around Mount Etna in Sicily, the most active volcano in Europe.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Ally McHugh with the BBC News. The electoral commission in the Democratic Republic of Congo says it's delaying Sunday's presidential election in three cities until March due to insecurity and an outbreak of the Ebola virus. The decision in effect cancels the vote in Beni and Butembo in North Kivu province and Yumbi in the west of the country because the new president is due to be sworn in by the middle of January. Here's Will Ross. The Congolese electoral commission says it's taken this decision to save lives. There'll be no voting until March in Beni and Butembo in the east of the country because it says there would be a risk the Ebola virus could spread if people travel to the polling stations. A statement also said any election there would provide an opportunity for armed groups to carry out attacks. The timing of this announcement is surprising, considering the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo began in August, and the numerous rebel groups have been active there for years. Perhaps less surprising is the decision to delay the vote in Yumbi in the west, where more than one hundred people were killed in ethnic clashes earlier this month.\nA UN-led ceasefire monitoring team is reported to have met for the first time in the Yemeni port of Hodeida. Details of what was discussed are yet to emerge. The team is expected to work to secure a shaky truce in the city. Alan Johnston has the details. The monitoring team is being headed by a UN-appointed retired Dutch general, and it includes representatives of both the government and the rebels. The two sides recently agreed to a truce in Hodeida, but sporadic fighting has continued. Now the ceasefire monitoring committee is reported to have held its first meeting. Its efforts to make the truce work will be hugely important. Hodeida is a key link in the effort to ship food aid into Yemen where millions of people are threatened by starvation.\nReports from Italy say ten people have been injured following an earthquake in the area around Mount Etna in Sicily, the most active volcano in Europe. James Reynolds has this report. The earthquake hit the slopes of Mount Etna at around twenty past three in the morning. It damaged nearby homes and buildings. In the village of Fleri, an eighty-year-old man had to be rescued from his home. Some decided to take shelter in their cars or in local gyms, anywhere just to be safe. In recent days, scientists recorded more than a hundred tremors, causing the authorities to restrict flights to the regional airports in the city of Catania. James Reynolds reporting. This is the world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是艾琳·麦克尤，欢迎收听BBC新闻。刚果民主共和国的选举委员会宣布，将原定于周日在三个城市举行的大选推迟到3月，原因是不安全因素以及埃博拉病毒的爆发。该决定实际上取消了在贝尼、北基伍省的布滕博以及西部的永比地区的选举活动，因为新总统将会在一月中旬宣誓就职。以下是威尔·罗斯的报道。刚果选举委员会表示采取该措施是为了挽救生命。三月份之前贝尼，以及东部城市布滕博不会举行选举，因为他们担心人们前往投票站会有传播埃博拉的风险。一份声明也表示该地区的选举活动将会给武装分子发动袭击提供机会。该决定宣布的时机令人意外，因为埃博拉病毒8月份就在刚果东部爆发了，另外多个反叛组织已经在该地区活跃了多年。在西部的永比地区推迟选举就没有那么令人意外，因为本月初这里有一百多人在种族冲突中被杀。\n据报道，一个联合国主导的停火监督小组已经在也门港口城市荷台达举行了首次会议。会议讨论的细节尚未公布。该小组有望保证荷台达脆弱的停火协议继续维持，以下是艾伦·约翰斯顿的报道。该监督小组由联合国任命的荷兰退休将军带领，包括政府和反对派双方的代表。双方近期同意在荷台达停火，但是仍有零星的战斗爆发。现在，据报道停火监督委员会已经举行了第一次会议。他们为停火做出的努力将会至关重要。荷台达是将救援食物送往也门地区的关键节点，在也门有数百万人正受到饥饿的威胁。\n意大利的报道称有10人在西西里岛埃特纳火山附近的地震中受伤，该火山也是欧洲最活跃的火山。以下是詹姆斯·雷诺兹的报道。该地震在早上3:20袭击了埃特纳火山的山坡，导致附近的居民房屋建筑受损。在弗莱里村，一名80岁当地老人现已从家中被救出。一些人决定去车中或者是当地的体育馆等安全的地方避难。最近几天以来，科学家记录到了100多次地震，导致政府限制了飞往卡特尼亚市机场的航班。以上是詹姆斯·雷诺兹的报道。BBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News.\nPresident Trump has used a surprise Christmas visit to US troops in Iraq to defend his decision to pull American forces out of Syria. Mr. Trump said the withdrawal would be gradual.\nThere will be a strong, deliberate and orderly withdrawal of US forces from Syria, very deliberate, very orderly, while maintaining the US presence in Iraq to prevent an ISIS resurgence and to protect US interests, and also to always watch very closely over any potential reformation of ISIS and also to watch over Iran.\nDuring his visit to an airbase west of Baghdad, President Trump spoke to the Iraqi Prime Minister over the telephone and invited him to Washington.\nShares in Tokyo have closed nearly four percent higher following earlier gains in New York. US shares bounced back after steep falls before Christmas. Kim Gittleson reports.\nAfter suffering their worst weekly performance in a decade, US shares made a roaring recovery, which once more had a knock-on effect on markets around the world. Investors seemed to shake off their pre-holiday jitters after positive US retail sales data soothe concerns about a slowdown in US economic activity. That push shares in companies like Amazon higher even amid thin trading volumes during the post Christmas week. The question of course, is whether this is a one-off rally or something that will be sustained into the New Year. The Dow-Jones Industrial Average would need to rise over eighteen hundred points over the next two days in order to end 2018 in the black.\nPolice in the Democratic Republic of Congo have fired tear gas at crowds protesting against the decision to further delay the presidential election. A BBC correspondent in the city of Goma said demonstrators are being dispersed. The vote which was due to take place on Sunday has now been postponed until March in three areas of the country.\nJapan has executed two inmates on death row. The Justice Minister said they were hanged at a detention center in the city of Osaka. The two men were convicted for the strangling of an investment firm executive and an employee thirty years ago. The hangings bring the total number of executions in Japan this year to fifteen. Japan has about one hundred death row convicts.\nThe US pop star Miley Cyrus has confirmed that she has married the Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, sharing images of their wedding on social media. The couple met nearly a decade ago on the set of the film, The Last Song.\nBBC world news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼尔•努内斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n特朗普在圣诞期间意外现身伊拉克访问驻地美军，以此捍卫他从叙利亚撤军的决定。特朗普表示撤军将会循序渐进地进行。\n从叙利亚撤军将会是一次大规模的、经过深思熟虑的并且是有条不紊的行动。该行动将非常谨慎有序地进行，同时也会保留美国在伊拉克的力量以防止ISIS死灰复燃并保护美国的权益，还将一直密切关注ISIS任何可能的复苏迹象并监督伊朗。在特朗普访问巴格达空军基地期间，特朗普总统与伊拉克总理通话并邀请他访问华盛顿。\n受早前纽约股市上涨推动，东京股票收盘上涨近4%。美股在圣诞节前暴跌后出现反弹。以下是金•吉特森的报道。\n在度过了十年中最糟糕的一周后，美股现在实现了大幅回升，又一次对全世界股市产生了影响。美国零售数据回升，缓解了人们对于美国经济活动放缓的担忧，也让投资者在圣诞节前松了一口气，这也促使亚马逊等公司股价走高，尽管圣诞节后一周交易量不高。当然问题是，此次股市回升是暂时性的，还是会延续至新的一年。在未来两天内，道琼斯工业指数增长需要超过1800点才能在2018年年底实现盈利。\n刚果民主共和国警方向抗议进一步推迟总统大选的游行民众投掷了催泪弹。戈马市的一名BBC记者表示游行者正在被驱散。在该国的三个区域内，原定于周日举行的选举现已被推迟到了3月。\n日本现已处决了两名死刑犯，日本法务大臣表示他们在大阪的一个拘留所被处以绞刑。两人因30年前勒死一家投资公司的一名管理人员和一名员工被判处死刑。加上本次绞刑，日本今年实施死刑总次数达到15次。日本约有100名死刑犯。\n美国女星麦莉•赛勒斯已证实与澳大利亚演员利亚姆•海姆斯沃斯完婚，并在社交媒体上分享了他们的结婚照。两人约10年前在电影《最后一支歌》片场相识。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>BBC News with Kris Barrow.\nPresident Trump has made a Christmas visit to US troops in Iraq, his first trip to see soldiers under his command in a combat zone. He comes days after his Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in a dispute over the President’s decision to pull US forces out of Syria and look at a slash of the American contingent in Afghanistan.\nRussia says it’s acquired a new type of nuclear capable hypersonic missile. The Russia President Vladimir Putin said the weapon could penetrate any existing or next-generation missile defense system. Moscow says the Avangard missile launched in the Ural Mountains hit a target 6,000 kilometers away.\nSunday’s presidential election in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been postponed until March in three areas. The authorities claimed insecurity under an outbreak of Ebola for the decision.\nThe electoral authorities in Afghanistan have delayed next year’s presidential poll by three months. Sources have told the BBC that many potential candidates have been unable to meet registration requirements, and extreme weather meant their teams could not be ready for the scheduled vote in April.\nA father whose dead son has become a focus for anti-government protests in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been released after a night in police custody. Lawyers for Davor Dragicevic said police had no grounds for detaining him.\nThe price of gold has hit a six-month high amid fears of slowing global growth and economic volatility, especially in the United States. Confidence in US markets has been hit by a string of concerns, including the partial government shutdown caused by President Trump’s dispute with Congress over funding for his planned border wall.\nA French adventurer has set off to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a barrel-shaped capsule, using ocean currents alone to propel him. 71-year-old Jean Jacques Savin left the Spanish Island of El Hierro and hopes to reach the Caribbean in some 4,500 kilometers away in as little as three months.\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\nKris Barrow为您播报BBC新闻。\n圣诞节期间，特朗普总统访问了美国驻伊军队，这是他首次看望战区的美国士兵。在此数天前，国防部部长吉姆·马蒂斯离任。因为有争议是关于特朗普决定撤出美国驻叙利亚军队，并且意图削减美国驻阿富汗士兵。\n俄罗斯称其已获得一种新型高超音速核导弹。俄罗斯总统普京表示，该导弹可以穿透任何现有的以及下一代导弹防御系统。俄罗斯政府表示，该导弹，即先锋高超音速核导弹，已在乌拉尔山脉试飞，可以将目标击飞6000公里远。\n预计于周日举行刚果民主共和国总统大选已在3个地区被推迟到了明年3月。当局表示存在不安全隐患，因为有可能爆发埃博拉病毒，所以出此下策。\n阿富汗选举当局将明年的总统票选推迟了3个月。知情人士在接受BBC采访时表示，很多可能当选的候选人无法满足登记要求。而寒冷的天气也意味着选举团队起码要等到4月才能开启票选。\n一位男孩成为波斯尼亚―黑塞哥维亚反政府抗议的焦点。其父亲在警局被监禁一夜后得以释放。这位父亲名为Davor Dragicevic，其律师表示，警方没有理由监禁他。\n黄金价格已达过去半年来的新高，虽然现在有人担心会出现全球经济放缓与经济波动，尤其是美国的经济放缓与波动。外界对美国市场的信心受到了冲击，原因有多个。其中一个就是美国政府部分停摆。停摆是因为特朗普总统与美国国会之间出现争议，争议的主题是是否要为特朗普计划建造的边境墙提供资金。\n某法国探险家已出发，准备跨越大西洋。他乘坐的是一个桶状的容器，只靠洋流的作用来提供推力。今年71岁的他名为让·雅克，他离开了西班牙的耶罗岛，希望能够用3个月的时间抵达4500公里外的加勒比。\nBBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>**A special letter**\n**一封特殊的信**\nDear World:\n亲爱的世界：\nMy son starts school today.\n我的儿子今天就要开始上学读书了。\nIt's going to be strange and new to him for a while, and I wish you would sort of treat him gently.\n一时之间，他会感觉陌生而又新鲜。我希望你能待他温柔一些。\nYou see, up to now, he's been king of the roost.\n你明白，到现在为止，他一直是家中的小皇帝。\nHe's been boss of the backyard.\n一直是后院的王者。\nI have always been around to repair his wounds, and to make him calm.\n我一直在他身旁，忙着为他治疗伤口，哄他开心。\nBut now--things are going to be different.\n但是现在--一切都将不同了。\nThis morning, he's going to walk down the front steps, wave his hand and start on his great adventure that will probably include wars and tragedy and sorrow.\n今天清晨，他就要走下前门的楼梯，冲我挥手，然后开始他的伟大的历险征程，其间或许有争斗、不幸以及伤痛。\nTo live his life in the world he has to live in will require faith and love and courage.\n既然活在这个世上，他就需要信念、爱心和勇气。\nSo, World, I wish you would sort of take him by his young hand and teach him the things he will have to know.\n所以，世界啊，我希望你能够时不时握住他稚嫩的小手，传授他所应当知晓的事情。\nTeach him - but gently, if you can.\n教育他吧--而如果可能的话，温柔一些。\nTeach him that for every scoundrel there is a hero; that for every crooked politician there is a dedicated leader; that for every enemy there is a friend.\n教他知道，每有恶人之地，必有豪杰所在；每有奸诈小人，必有献身义士；每见一敌人，必有一友在侧。\nTeach him the wonders of books.\n教他感受书本的神奇魅力。\nGive him quiet time to ponder the eternal mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and flowers on the green hill.\n给他时间静思大自然中亘古绵传之奥秘：空中的飞鸟，日光里的蜜蜂，青山上的簇簇繁花。\nTeach him it is far more honorable to fail than to cheat.\n教他知道，失败远比欺骗更为光荣。\nTeach him to have faith in his own ideas, even if everyone tells him they are wrong.\n教他坚定自我的信念，哪怕人人予以否认。\nTeach him to sell his brawn and brains to the highest bidder, but never to put a price on his heart and soul.\n教他可以最高价付出自己的精力和智慧，但绝不可出卖良心和灵魂。\nTeach him to close his ears to a howling mob...and to stand and fight if he thinks he's right.\n教他置暴徒的喧嚣于度外……并在自觉正确之时挺身而战。\nTeach him gently, World, but don't coddle him, because only the test of fire makes fine steel.\n温柔地教导他吧，世界，但是不要放纵他，因为只有烈火的考验才能炼出真钢。\nThis is a big order, World, but see what you can do.\n这一要求甚高，世界，但是请尽你所能。\nHe's such a nice little fellow.\n他是一个如此可爱的小家伙。

        <markdown-content>**Eternal Promise**\n**永恒的承诺**\nIn 1989 an 8.2 earthquake almost flattened America, killing over 30,000 people in less than four minutes. In the midst of utter devastation and chaos, a father left his wife safely at home and rushed to the school where his son was supposed to be, only to discover that the building was as flat as a pancake.\n1989年，一次8.2级的地震几乎铲平美国，在短短不到4分钟的时间里，夺去了3万多人的生命！在彻底的破坏与混乱之中，有位父亲将他的妻子在家里安顿好后，跑到他儿子就读的学校，而触目所见，却是被夷为平地的校园。\nAfter the unforgettably initial shock, he remembered the promise he had made to his son: "No matter what, I’ll always be there for you!" And tears began to fill his eyes. As he looked at the pile of ruins that once was the school, it looked hopeless, but he kept remembering his commitment to his son.\n看到这令人伤心的一幕，他想起了曾经对儿子所作的承诺："不论发生什么事，我都会在你身边。"至此，父亲热泪满眶。目睹曾经的学校成为了一堆瓦砾，真叫人绝望。但父亲的脑中仍然牢记着他对儿子的诺言。\nHe began to direct his attention towards where he walked his son to class at school each morning. Remembering his son s classroom would be in the back right corner of the building; he rushed there and started digging through the ruins.\n他开始努力回忆每天早上送儿子上学的必经之路，终于记起儿子的教室应该就在那幢建筑物后面，位于右边的角落里，他跑到那儿，开始在碎石砾中挖掘，搜寻儿子的下落。\nAs he was digging, other helpless parents arrived, clutching their hearts, saying: "My son!" "My daughter!" Other well meaning parents tried to pull him off what was left of the school, saying: "It s too late! They’re all dead! You can’t help! Go home! Come on, face reality, there s nothing you can do!"\n当这位父亲正在挖掘时，其他束手无策的学生家长赶到现场，揪心地叫着："我的儿子呀！" "我的女儿呀！"一些好意的家长试图把这位父亲劝离现场，告诉他"一切都太迟了！"他们全死了！"这样做没用的"，"回去吧，这样做只会使事情更糟"。\nTo each parent he responded with one line: "Are you going to help me now?" And then he continued to dig for his son, stone by stone. The fire chief showed up and tried to pull him off the school s ruins saying, "Fires are breaking out, explosions are happening everywhere. You’re in danger. We’ll take care of it. Go home." To which this loving, caring American father asked, "Are you going to help me now?"\n面对种种劝告，这位父亲的回答只有一句话："你们愿意帮我吗？"然后继续进行挖掘工作，在废墟中寻找他的儿子。消防队长出现了，他也试图把这位父亲劝走，对他说："火灾频现，四处都在发生爆炸，你在这里太危险了，这边的事我们会处理，你回家吧！"对此，这位慈爱、关切的父亲仍然回答："你们要帮我吗？"\nThe police came and said, "You’re angry, anxious and it s over. You’re endangering others. Go home. We’ll handle it!" To which he replied, "Are you going to help me now?" No one helped.Courageously he went on alone because he needed to know for himself: "Is my boy alive or is he dead?" He dug for eight hours...12 hours...24 hours...36 hours...then, in the 38th hour, he pulled back a large stone and heard his son s voice. He screamed his son s name, "ARMAND!" He heard back, "Dad!?! It s me, Dad! I told the other kids not to worry. I told them that if you were alive, you d save me and when you saved me, they d be saved. You promised, No matter what happens, I’ll always be there for you! You did it, Dad!" "What s going on in there? How is it?" the father asked.\n警察赶到现场，对他说："你现在又气又急，该结束了，你在危及他人，回家吧！我们会处理一切的。"这位父亲依旧回答："你们愿意帮我吗？" 然而，人们无动于衷。为了弄清楚儿子是死是活，这位父亲独自一人鼓起勇气，继续进行他的工作。他挖掘了8小时，--12小时，24小时，36小时--38小时后，父亲推开了一块巨大的石头，听到了儿子的声音。父亲尖叫着："阿曼德！"儿子的回音听到了："爸爸吗？是我，爸，我告诉其他的小朋友不要着急。我告诉他们如果你活着，你会来救我的。如果我获救了，他们也就获救了。你答应过我， 不论发生什么，我永远都会在你的身边， 你做到了，爸！""你那里的情况怎样？"父亲问。\nThere are 14 of us left out of 33, Dad. We’re scared, hungry, thirsty and thankful you re here. When the building collapsed, it made a triangle, and it saved us.\n我们有33个，只有14个活着。爸，我们好害怕，又渴又饿，谢天谢地，你在这儿。教室倒塌时，刚好形成一个三角形的洞，救了我们。\nCome out, boy!\n快出来吧！儿子！\nNo, Dad! Let the other kids out first, cause I know you ll get me! No matter what happens, I know you’ll always be there for me!\n不，爸，让其他小朋友先出来吧！因为我知道你会接我的！不管发生什么事，我知道你永远都会来到我的身边！

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Nick Kelly with the BBC News.\nPolling stations have opened in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo for the country's long delayed presidential election. It could result in the country's first peaceful transfer of power. President Joseph Kabila is stepping down after seventeen years. From Kinshasa, Louise Dewast reports.\nAs polling stations open across this vast country, almost the size of Western Europe, tensions are high. It's still unclear if all polling stations are ready. For the first time, voting will be done using electronic voting machines despite concerns they could be used to rig the vote in favor of the ruling party's candidate. The front runners are Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, a close ally of President Kabila, and two opposition candidates Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi.\nBangladesh is holding a general election with more than a hundred million people eligible to vote. Heavy security is in place after a campaign marred by violence and allegations of a crackdown against the opposition. The Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is seeking a third successive term. Yogita Limaye is in Dhaka.\nEven before eight am when polls opened, there were lots of people waiting outside. It is still largely a paper ballot, so it's on a piece of paper that they will make their choice. But for the first time in a national election in Bangladesh, electronic voting machines are also being used in six constituencies. In the run-up to this election, we've seen several violent instances, several people being killed, scores being injured. And so there's a heavy security deployment all across the city as well as the country and in fact, even mobile internet has been slowed down for security reasons.\nThe Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo says his government is investigating a possible plot to assassinate the President Ivan Duque. He said investigators were trying to establish where the three Venezuelans arrested earlier this month in Colombia with military weapons are connected to the alleged plot.\nFor several months, intelligence services have been investigating possible attacks on the life of the president. On top of this, we have the recent capture of three Venezuelan citizens who were found with weapons of war. This increases the concerns of the authorities in this matter.\nPresident Duque is due to meet the US Secretary of State next week to discuss escalating tensions with Venezuela. He's asked countries not to recognize the new government of the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼克•凯利，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n刚果民主共和国东部的总统选举投票站已经开放，该国总统选举被长期推延。这可能将是该国权力的首次和平移交。总统约瑟夫•卡比拉在执政17年后即将下台。以下是路易斯•德瓦斯特在金沙萨的报道。\n刚果民主共和国幅员辽阔，接近整个西欧的大小，随着投票点的开放，紧张气氛也日益增加。现在还不清楚是否所有的选举点都做好了准备。在投票中将首次使用电子投票机，虽然有人担心这些机器会被用来操纵投票，从而为执政党候选人谋利。得票领先的候选人包括伊曼纽尔•拉马扎尼•沙迪尔，他是总统卡比拉的亲密盟友，以及两名反对党候选人马丁•法尤鲁和费利克斯•齐塞克迪。\n孟加拉国正在举行大选，有资格投票的选民超过一亿。因为此前选举期间的暴力活动和以及对反对党的镇压活动，严格的安保措施已经就位。总理谢赫•哈西娜正在寻求第三届连任。以下是尤吉塔•利玛耶在达卡的报道。\n在早上8点投票开始之前，就有很多人在外等候。投票形式绝大部分都是纸面选票，也就是说人们将会在纸上做出自己的选择。但是在孟加拉的全国大选中，电子投票机也首次在六个选区使用。在选举的准备阶段，我们看到了一些暴力事件，数人被杀，多人受伤。所以现在有大量的安全力量被部署在该市以及全国，甚至移动互联网都因安全因素而降速。\n哥伦比亚外长卡洛斯•奥尔梅斯•特鲁希略表示政府正在调查疑似密谋刺杀总统伊万•杜克一案。他表示调查人员正在尝试找到本月初在哥伦比亚逮捕的三名持有军方武器的委内瑞拉人与这起刺杀阴谋的联系。\n几个月以来，情报人员一直在调查有可能对总统发起的刺杀行动，此外我们还逮捕了三名携带战争武器的委内瑞拉市民。这也增加了政府对该事件的担忧。\n总统杜克将于下周会见美国国务卿，讨论与委内瑞拉不断升级的紧张关系。他呼吁各国不要认可以尼古拉斯•马杜拉为总统的委内瑞拉新政府。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>**A box full of kisses**\n**装满吻的盒子**\nThe story goes that some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree. Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, "This is for you, Daddy.”\n有这样一个故事，爸爸因为三岁的女儿浪费了一卷金色的包装纸而惩罚了她。家里很缺钱，当孩子想要用包装纸装饰一个挂在圣诞树上的盒子时，爸爸生气了。然而，第二天早上小女孩把盒子作为礼物送给了爸爸，“这是给你的，爸爸。”\nThe man was embarrassed by his earlier overreaction, but his anger flared again when he found out the box was empty. He yelled at her, stating, "Don't you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside? The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried, "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They're all for you, Daddy."\n女儿的这个行为让爸爸感到尴尬。但是当他发现盒子是空的时候，他的怒火再一次燃烧了。他对女儿喊道，“难道你不知道给别人礼物的时候，里面应该放有东西吗？”多女孩抬头看着父亲，眼里含着泪水，“爸爸，盒子不是空的。我把吻放在了盒子里，都是给你的，爸爸。”\nThe father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness. Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. It is also told that her father kept that gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.\n爸爸感动极了，他搂住女儿，恳请她的原谅。之后不久，一场事故夺走了小女孩的生命。据说，父亲便将那个小金盒子放在床头，一直陪伴着他的余生。无论何时他感到气馁或者遇到难办的事情，他就会打开礼盒，取出一个假想的吻，记起漂亮女儿给予了自己特殊的爱。\nIn a very real sense, each one of us, as humans beings, have been given a gold container filled with unconditional love and kisses... from our children, family members, friends, and God. There is simply no other possession, anyone could hold, more precious than this.\n从一个非常真实的意义上说，我们每个人都被赠与过一个无形的金色礼盒，那里面装满了来自子女，家人，朋友及上帝无条件的爱与吻。人们所能拥有的最珍贵的礼物莫过于此了。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Debbie Russ with the BBC News. Scientists with the American Space Agency NASA believed their New Horizons probe has successfully encountered the most distant object ever to be explored in the solar system. The robotic craft was due to fly past the icy massive Ultima Thule. The scientists cheered to mark the moment, but it will take several hours for the probe to communicate with home. Planetary scientist Dr. Carly Howett of the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado is waiting for the information to come back from the probe. It's traveling so fast that we are, entire encounter is about three hours long. The target is very small. Ultima Thule, we think is somewhere between sort of probably around twenty miles across, but it's very far from earth. It's about 6.5 billion kilometers. So this is exciting because it's exploring something that we really have never seen before. This is an object like we've seen never seen. So it's true exploration at its finest. So we're waiting with bated breath for the data to come down.\nThe North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has warned that he may change his approach to relations with the United States if it maintains sanctions. Laura Bicker reports. Sitting in his office flanked by huge portraits of his father and grandfather, Kim Jong-un made his annual televised address to the North Korean people. But at the end, there was a message for Donald Trump. Mr. Kim said that if Washington continued with its pressure and sanctions on Pyongyang and misjudged his country's patience, then he would have no choice but to seek a new path. This may mean that North Korea is waiting for the US to act in 2019, and unless it does, the current pause on nuclear weapons testing could be over.\nThe new Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will be sworn in later today. The far-right politician has promised to immediately relax gun laws. Katy Watson has this report from the capital Brasilia. Today marks a new direction for Brazil, but the political path of this country is uncertain. Mr. Bolsonaro campaigned as an outsider, pledging to drain the swamp of corrupt politicians. For those who voted him in, he represents change. People here are fed up with the political establishment, many of whom have been embroiled in corruption scandals in the past few years. While financial markets are hopeful, he could help turn around Brazil's troubled economy, many fear his conservative politics and aggressive attitude will only worsen the lives of poorer and more vulnerable Brazilians.

        <markdown-content>**On Christmas Eve**\n**圣诞之夜**\nA friend of mine named Paul received an automobile from his brother as Christmas present. On Christmas eve, when Paul came out of his office, a street urchin was walking around the shining new car, admiring it.\n我有个朋友，保罗，在圣诞节那天收到了一份来自他哥哥的礼物，一辆轿车。在圣诞前夜，当保罗从他的办公室走出来时，一个街头顽童正围着他的新车打转地看，非常羡慕。\nIs this your car, Mister? he said.\n“这是您的汽车吗，先生？”他说。\nPaul nodded, "My brother gave it to me for Christmas."\n保罗点了点头，“我哥哥给我的圣诞礼物。\nThe boy was astounded, "You mean your brother gave it to you, and didn't cost you anything?"\n小男孩诧异了，“你是说你哥哥给你的，不用花你一分钱？”\nBoy, I wish... he hesitated.\n“兄弟，我希望...”他迟疑了。\nOf course Paul knew what he was going to wish for. He was going to wish he had a brother like that. But what the lad said jarred Paull all the way down his heels.\n保罗当然清楚他希望什么，他希望他也有个那样的哥哥。但这个小家伙说的话，使保罗大吃了一惊。\nI wish, the boy went on, "that I could be a brother like that."\n“我希望，”小男孩继续说道，“我可以做一个那样的哥哥。”\nPaul looked at the boy in astonishment, then inpulsivly he added, "Would you like to take a ride in my car?"\n保罗惊奇地看着小男孩，然后激动地说了句，“你想不想做我的车去兜兜风？”\nOh, yes. I'd love that.\n“哦，想！我喜欢！”\nAfter a short ride, the boy turned his eyes aglow, said, "Mister, would you mind driving in front of my house?"\n跑了一小段路后，小男孩眼光水灵闪闪地说道，“先生，您可以把车开到我家门前吗？”\nPaul smiled a little. He thought he knew what the lad wanted. He wanted to show his neighbours that he could ride home in a big automobile. But Paul was wrong again.\n保罗微微一笑。他觉得他知道这个小家伙想要干什么，他想要向他的邻居炫耀他可以坐一辆大汽车回家。但是，保罗又一次想错了。\nWould you stop at those with two steps? the boy asked.\n“您可以在那有两个台阶的房子前停下吗？” 小男孩问道。\nHe ran up stairs. Then in a little while, Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He was carrying his little crippled brother. He set him down on the bottom step. Then a sort of squeezed up against him and pointed to the car.\n他跑着上楼去了。然后一小会儿，保罗听到他回来的脚步声，但他没再用跑的了。保罗看见他正搀扶着他的跛脚的弟弟，他扶着他坐在最底层的台阶上，然后拥抱着他，指着这部车。\nThere she is, buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother gave it to him for Christmas and didn't cost him a cent. And some day, I'm gonna give you one just like it. Then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the chirstmas windows that I was trying to tell you about.\n“小弟，那就是我在楼上跟你说的那部车。他哥哥给他的圣诞礼物，不用花他一分钱。将来某天我也要给你一部像那样的车，那样你就可以自己去看我以前尽力想让你知道的那些窗边的圣诞饰品了。”\nPaul got off and lifted the lad into the front of his car. The shinning eyed old brother crimbed in beside him. And three of them began a memorable holiday ride.\n保罗下车把跛脚的小孩抱上了车的前座，他的眼睛水灵灵的哥哥爬上了车，坐到了他旁边。然后他们三个开始一段令人难忘的旅程。\nThat Christmas eve, Paul learned what Jesus meant, when he said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive..."\n那个圣诞前夜，保罗收获了很多，他真正体会了耶稣所说的那句话，“施舍比接受更有福...”

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC news.\nA Chinese robotic probe has become the first spacecraft to land on the far side of the moon. State media in Beijing have confirmed within the last hour that the Chang'e-4 probe had touched down successfully. John Southworth is in Beijing.\nIt marks a milestone in space exploration. Never before attempted, the mission faced serious challenges, including landing on the much more rugged terrain of the moon's far side and the need for a relay satellite to bring the signals back home. The Chang'e-4 probe named after a Chinese goddess has touched down close to the moon's south pole in its oldest and deepest crater. The experiments on board are expected to offer important insights into the formation of our solar system.\nDeadlock continues in Washington after discussions between President Trump and leaders of Congress failed to resolve the budget dispute that's caused the partial government shutdown. David Willis has more.\nA new session of Congress convenes later today with Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives, and the party's leadership is planning to pass legislation which would provide sufficient funds to end the partial shutdown, all be it with none of the five billion dollars President Trump wants for the wall. Such legislation will be dead on arrival in the Senate, however, where Republicans still hold the majority. President Trump has said the current partial government shutdown would last as long as it takes for him to get the border wall funding that he requires.\nScientists say they have discovered the source of a cholera outbreak in Yemen, which has become one of the worst epidemics of the disease in recorded history. British and French researchers have identified the cholera strain as one that originated in eastern Africa and was probably carried to Yemen by migrants. Yemen has seen more than a million cases of cholera.\nZimbabwe's biggest drinks company Delta has announced that from Friday it will only accept payment in hard currency such as US dollars. The firm said it had been hit by a shortage of foreign currency needed to pay its overseas suppliers.

The men, one British, the other Iranian, were held in the city of Manchester.

        <markdown-content>**Not a Simple Dress**\n**不凡的连衣裙**\n“Do you like my dress?"she asked of a passing stranger."\n“你喜欢我的连衣裙吗？“她问一位正走过她身边的陌生人。\nMy mommy made it just for me.She said with a tear in her eyes.\n我妈妈专给我做的。”她说道，眼里冒出了泪珠。\nWell,I think it's very pretty,so tell me little one,why are you crying?\n“嗯，我认为你的裙子真漂亮。告诉我，小姑娘，你为什么哭呢？”\nWith a quiver in her voice the little girl answered."After Mommy made me this dress,she had to go away."\n小姑娘声音有些颤抖，回答道：“我妈妈给我做完这条裙子后就不得不离开了。”\nWell,now,said the lady,"with a little girl like you waiting for her,I'm sure she'll be right back."\n“哦，是这样，”陌生的女士说，“有你这样一个小姑娘等着她，我敢肯定她很快就会回来的。”\nNo Ma'am,you don't understand,said the child through her tears,"my daddy said she's up in heaven now with Grandfather."\n“不，女士，您不明白，”女孩透过泪水说，“我爸说她现在和我爷爷在天堂里。”\nFinally the woman realized what the child meant,and why she was crying.Kneeling down she gently cradled the child in her arms and together they cried for the mommy that was gone.\n女士终于明白孩子的意思了，也明白她为什么哭泣。她跪下，温柔地把女孩搂在怀里，她们一起为离去的妈妈哭泣。\nThen suddenly the little girl did something that the woman thought was a bit strange.She stopped crying,stepped back from the woman and began to sing.She sang so softly that it was almost a whisper. It was the sweetest sound the woman had ever heard,almost like the song of a very small bird.\n忽然小姑娘又做了件让女士感到有点奇怪的事。她停住了哭泣，从女士怀抱中抽出身，向后退了一步，然后开始唱歌。她唱得如此轻柔，几乎像章晨低语。这是女士听到过的最甜美的声音，简直就像一只非常小的小鸟在吟唱。\nAfter the child stopped singing she explained to the lady,"My mommy used to sing that song to me before she went away,and she made me promise to sing it whenever I started crying and it would make me stop."\n小女孩唱完后解释说：“妈妈离去前经常给我唱这支歌，她让我答应她我一哭就唱这支歌，这样我就不哭了。”\n"See",she exclaimed,"it did,and now my eyes are dry!"\n“您瞧，”她惊叫道，“真管用，现在我的眼睛里没有眼泪了！”\nAs the woman turned to go,the little girl grabbed her sleeve,"Ma'am,can you stay just a minute?I want to show you something."\n女士转身要走时，小女孩抓住她的衣袖：“女士，您能再停留一小会儿吗？我想给您看点东西。”\nOf course,she answered,"what do you want me to see?"\n“当然可以，”她回答，“你想要我看什么呢？”\nPointing to a spot on her dress,she said,"Right here is where my mommy kissed my dress,and here,"pointing to another spot,"and here is another kiss, and here,and here.Mommy said that she put all those kisses on my dress so that I would have her kisses for every booboo'that made me cry."\n小女孩指着裙子上的一处，说：“就在这里，我妈妈亲了我的裙子，还有这里，”她指着另外一处，“这里有另外一个吻，还有这里，这里。妈妈说她把所有这些吻都留在我的连衣裙上，这样我遇到什么事哭了，就会有她的亲吻。”\nThen the lady realized that she wasn't just looking at a dress,no,she was looking at a mother…who knew that she was going away and would not be there to kiss away the hurts that she knew her daughter would get.\n这时，女士意识到在她眼前的不是一件连衣裙，不是的，她在凝视一位母亲……这位母亲知道她将离去，无法随时守候在女儿身边，吻去她知道女儿必然会遇到的种种伤心事。\nSo she took all the love she had for her beautiful little girl and put them into this dress,which her child now so proudly wore.\n所以她将所有对她美丽女儿的爱倾注在这件连衣裙上。现在，女儿如此骄傲地穿在身上。\nShe no longer saw a little girl in a simple dress. She saw a child wrapped…in her mother's love.\n她看到的不再是身穿一件简单的连衣裙的小女孩。她看到的是一个……被妈妈的爱裹着的孩子。

        <markdown-content>BBC news. I'm John Shay.\nRussia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov says the country is not willing to consider a prisoner swap involving the former US Marine Paul Whelan. He was arrested in Moscow over a week ago on suspicion of spying. His families say he's innocent. From Moscow, here's Sarah Rainsford. Sergei Ryabkov described the arrest of Paul Whelan as very serious and said that at this stage, talk of swapping him for any Russian detainee was inappropriate, counter-productive and politically unjustified. His comments came after days of speculation that the former US Marine may have been arrested to exchange for Maria Butina who has pleaded guilty in the US to conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of Moscow. Russia's Foreign Ministry and President Putin have condemned that case repeatedly and loudly. Sergei Ryabkov said there is no link between Mr. Whelan's arrest here in Moscow and other detentions.\nA document officially recognizing the independence of Ukraine's Orthodox Church from Russia has been signed at a ceremony at St. George's Cathedral in Istanbul. The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko attended the signing of the document known as "tomos". Jonah Fisher is in Kiev. What the "tomos" does is it recognizes that Ukraine has its own branch of the Christian Orthodox Church, crucially a branch that is separate from the Russian Orthodox Church, because for the last three hundred years or so, the Ukrainian parishes have been under the overall responsibility of the Russian Orthodox Church. That will no longer be the case. This "tomos" has been signed. It now grants official recognition to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. That's why the Russians are so upset and the Ukrainians are so happy.\nOpposition demonstrators in Hungary are due to resume protest shortly against the policies of the far-right government of Viktor Orban. The rallies began last month in response to a controversial law that extends overtime. Nick Thorpe is in Budapest. Today's demonstration is a litmus test to the degree of anger in Hungary against the overtime law, and of the determination of those willing to come out onto the streets. Heavy snow in the past twenty four hours across the country could reduce numbers. They're threatening nationwide strikes unless their four main demands are met. The scrapping of the overtime law, double-digit wage increases, the removal of limitations on the right to strike and a far-reaching pension reform. The Fidesz government has already offered an eight percent wage increase this year, followed by another eight percent next year in an attempt to head off the discontent.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，我是约翰·席亚。\n俄罗斯外交部副部长谢尔盖·里亚布科夫表示俄罗斯不会考虑交换前海军陆战队队员保罗·韦兰。一周前，韦兰因间谍指控被捕。他的家人称他是无辜的。以下是萨拉·雷恩福德在莫斯科的报道。谢尔盖·里亚布科夫表示逮捕保罗·韦兰是非常严肃的，在此节点上讨论用他来交换俄罗斯在押人员是不合适的、起反作用的并且在政治上也是不公正的。在他发表此番言论的前几天，人们猜测逮捕韦兰的目的是交换玛丽亚·布缇娜。她已在美国承认是俄罗斯的一名未注册间谍。俄罗斯外交部和总统普京曾多次强烈地对该案进行谴责。谢尔盖·里亚布科夫表示，逮捕韦兰与其它扣押无关。\n一份官方承认乌克兰东正教会从俄罗斯独立的文件现已在伊斯坦布尔圣乔治大教堂的一个仪式中签署。乌克兰总统佩特罗·波罗申科参加了这份名为“tomos”的文件签署仪式。以下是乔纳·费希尔在基辅的报道。这份“tomos”文件承认了乌克兰有了自己的东正教分支，最重要是独立于俄罗斯东正教的分支。因为在过去的300多年里，乌克兰教区一直都在俄罗斯东正教会的全权负责之下。情况将不再如此，这份“ tomos”文件已签署，它官方承认了乌克兰东正教正教会的合法性。这也是俄罗斯人如此沮丧而乌克兰人如此开心的原因。\n匈牙利的反对派示威人员将不久后重启游行活动，抗议维克托·欧尔班极右翼政府的政策。抗议集会开始于上个月，是为了反对一项有争议的延长加班时间的法律。以下是尼克·索普在布达佩斯的报道。今天的抗议活动将会检验人们对于这项延长加班时间的法律愤怒程度以及人们出门参加游行的决心。在过去的24小时内匈牙利全国范围内下了大雪，这可能会减少游行人群的数量。他们威胁称，如果他们的四项主要要求不能满足，将会发起全国范围内的罢工。这四项要求是取消延长加班时间的法律，两位数的工资增长，取消对于罢工权的限制以及彻底的退休金改革。匈牙利青年民主党政府今年已经为他们提供了8%的工资增长，为了防止民众不满意，明年还会继续增长8%。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>I'm Rosemary Crick with a look at the latest BBC news.\nCarlos Ghosn, the former chairman of the Japanese Carmaker Nissan, has appeared in public for the first time since his arrest in November on suspicion of financial misconduct. He's attended a hearing at the Tokyo District Court. Here is Rupert Wingfield-Hayes.\nMr. Ghosn came in wearing a dark suit without a tie on. He was handcuffed around the waist. He then went on to make a very robust statement in which he categorically denied the allegations against him. He said he had been wrongly accused on meritless and unsubstantiated allegations and he said he had not received any compensation from Nissan Motor Corporation that was not disclosed. So a very direct rebuttal of the allegations and the legal accusations that have been made against him by the prosecutors here.\nThe US National Security Advisor John Bolton is in Turkey for what is expected to be tense talks on the planned withdrawal of American troops from Syria. Last month, Donald Trump promised that all US forces would leave immediately, but on Sunday, Mr. Bolton insisted they stay until the last Islamic State militants were defeated. From Istanbul, Celine Garrett reports.\nDonald Trump first announced the withdrawal of US troops from Syria, after a phone call with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last month. This was a move Ankara had long hoped for. Once US troops pulled out of northern Syria, the Turkish military would be able to cross the border to drive out Kurdish forces, which Turkey sees as terrorists. But with the Kurds turning to Russia for protection, Washington felt obliged to take a step back from Mr. Trump's announcement. His National Security Adviser John Bolton is trying to reassure Kurdish forces that they are still America's allies. That has left Turkey frustrated and it is very difficult to see Ankara agreeing to protect the Kurds. In today's talks, both sides will need to strike a delicate balance as neither wants to damage their relationship.\nThe governor of the US state of Tennessee has granted clemency to a woman who was sentenced to life in prison for murder when she was just sixteen. Cyntoia Brown said she was forced into prostitution and feared for her life when she shot a man dead in Nashville in 2004. She will be freed on parole in August but must remain under supervision for a further ten years.\nPresident of the World Bank Jim Yong Kim is stepping down three years before the end of his term. The bank gave no reason, though it said Mr. Kim would join the private sector and would focus on increasing infrastructure investments in developing countries.\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n我是罗丝玛丽·克里克，欢迎收听最新的BBC新闻\n日本汽车生产商日产的前董事长卡洛斯·戈恩公开露面，这是他自去年11月因涉嫌不当金融行为被捕后的首次露面。他出席了东京地区法院的听审。以下是鲁珀特·温菲尔德-海耶斯的报道。\n戈恩身穿黑色正装走进法院，但是没有打领带。他双手被手铐铐在腰侧。之后他做了强硬的声明，坚决否认了关于他的指控。他表示自己受到了错误的、不道德的且无事实根据的指控，他还坚称没有私拿日产汽车公司的任何报酬。总的来说，他对当地检察官的指控和法律诉讼做了直接的反驳。\n美国国家安全顾问约翰·博尔顿正在土耳其就美国拟从叙利亚撤军问题进行的紧张会谈。上个月，唐纳德·特朗普总统承诺所有美国军队将立即撤军，但是周日，博尔顿坚称在彻底打败伊斯兰国组织之前不会撤军。以下是赛琳·盖瑞特在伊斯坦布尔的报道。\n唐纳德·特朗普在上个月与土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安通话后首次宣布从叙利亚撤军。这也是土耳其一直以来希望的结果。一旦美国从叙利亚北部撤军，土耳其军队将可以穿越边境驱逐被他们视为恐怖分子的库尔德武装。但随着库尔德武装转而向俄罗斯寻求帮助，美国认为不得不暂缓实施特朗普的决定。特朗普的国家安全顾问约翰·博尔顿正试图向库尔德武装保证他们仍是美国的盟友。而这也让土耳其受挫，而且土耳其同意保护库尔德的可能性很小。在今天的谈判中，由于双方都不想损害彼此间的关系，他们将需要取得一个微妙的平衡。\n美国田纳西州的州长给予了一名女犯人宽大处理，该女性在16岁时因杀人被判终身监禁。辛托妮亚·布朗表示，2004年在纳什维尔，当时的她被迫卖淫且担心自己的生命安全因而开枪打死一人。她将在8月份被保释，但是在接下来的10年内将必须受到监控。\n世界银行行长金墉将提前三年卸任。世界银行并没有给出具体原因，虽然该行表示金墉将会进入私营领域并将关注增加对发展中国家基础设施投资的问题。\nBBC新闻

        <title>English Essence For Recitation - A Father's Love</title>
        <description>
            Daddy just didn’t know how to show love. It was Mom who held the family together. He just went to work every day and came home; she’d have a list of sins we’d committed and he’d scold us about them.

        <markdown-content>**A Father's Love**\n**父爱**\nDaddy just didn’t know how to show love. It was Mom who held the family together. He just went to work every day and came home; she’d have a list of sins we’d committed and he’d scold us about them.\n爸爸根本不知道怎样表达爱。把这个家维系在一起的人是妈妈。爸爸天天去上班，回家，然后是妈妈向他数落我们所做的一连串错事，爸爸再为了这些事把我们骂一顿。\nOnce when I stole a candy bar, he made me take it back and tell the man I stole it and that I’d pay for it. But it was Mom who understood I was just a kid.\n有一次我偷了一根棒棒糖。爸爸硬是要我送回去，还要我告诉卖糖的人是我偷了糖，并说我愿意帮他拆箱开包作为赔偿。但妈妈却理解我，她知道我只不过是个孩子。\nI broke my leg once on the playground swing and it was Mom who held me in her arms all the way to the hospital. Dad pulled the car right up to the door of the emergency room and when they asked him to move it saying the space was reserved for emergency vehicles, He shouted, “What do you think this is? A tour bus?”\n再有一次，我在操场荡秋千摔坏了腿，一路抱着我到医院的人是妈妈。爸爸将车正好停在急诊室门口。因为那儿是专供急救车停靠的，医院里的人就叫我爸爸把车开走。爸爸大声吼叫起来：“你以为这是什么车？难道是旅游车吗？”\nAt my birthday parties, Dad always seemed sort of out of place, He just busied himself blowing up balloons, setting up tables, and running errands, it was Mom who carried the cake with the candles on it for me to blow out.\n在我的生日聚会上，爸爸总显得有点不得其所。他不是忙于吹气球，就是摆桌子，或做些跑腿的活儿。将插着蜡烛的生日蛋糕捧进来让我吹灭的人总是妈妈。\nWhen I leaf through picture albums, people always ask, “What does your Dad took like?” “Who knows? He was always fiddling around with the camera taking everyone else’s picture. I must have a zillion pictures of Mom and me smiling together.”\n我随便翻阅相册时，别人总会问“你爸爸长什么模样？”这还真说不出。他总是摆弄着相机为别人拍照。我和妈妈在一起微笑的照片一定多得都数不清了。\nI remember when Mom told him to teach me how to ride a bicycle. I told him not to let it go, but he said it was time. I fell and Mom ran to pick me up, but he waved her off. I was so mad I showed him,I got right back on that bike and rode it myself. He didn’t even feel embarrassed and just smiled.\n我还记得有一次妈妈叫爸爸教我骑自行车。我叫他扶着车子别松手，他却说是时候了。我摔了下来，妈妈跑来扶我，他却挥手让妈妈开走。我真是气得发疯，决心非要让他看看我的本事不可。我马上骑上车，竟能一个人骑了。爸爸却一点也不尴尬，只是笑笑。\nWhen I went to college, Mom did all the writing. He just sent checks and a little note about how great his lawn looked now that I wasn’t playing football on it.\n我上大学了，给我的信总是妈妈写的。爸爸只知道寄钱，顶多附上一张便条，告诉我他的草坪现在修整得多么好，而如今我却不能在上面踢球。\nWhenever I called home, he acted like he wanted to talk, but he always said, “I’ll get your mother.”When I got married, it was Mom who cried. He just blew his nose loudly and left the room. All my life he said, “Where are you going? What time are you coming home? No, you cannot go.”\n每次我打电话回家，爸爸总像是有话要说，但结果他总是说“我把你妈叫来接”。我结婚的时候，妈妈哭了，爸爸只是大声打着鼻响，离走出了房间。在我一生中，他总是说：“你去哪儿？你什么时候回家？不，你不能去。”\nDaddy just didn’t know how to show love, unless…\n爸爸就是不知道怎样表达爱，只会这样……\nIs it possible he showed it and didn’t recognize it?\n爸爸向我们表达了爱，难道他只是没有意识到吗？

        <markdown-content>**The Key of a Car**\n**一把车钥匙**\nA young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.\n从前，有位年轻人即将大学生毕业。数月来，他一直渴望得到某汽车商产品陈列室中的一辆跑车。他知道，他那富有的父亲肯定买得起这辆车，于是，他便跟父亲说他很想得到那辆漂亮的跑车。\nAs Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his private study. His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped gift box. Curiously, but somewhat disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather-bound Bible, with the young man's name embossed in gold. Angrily, he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all your money you give me a Bible?" Then stormed out of the house, leaving the Bible.\n在毕业典礼即将来临的日子里，年轻人等待着父亲买下跑车的消息。终于，在毕业典礼那天上午，父亲将他叫到自己的书房，并告诉他，有他这么出色的儿子自己感到非常自豪而且非常爱他这个儿子。接着，父亲递给儿子一个包装精美的礼品盒。年轻人感到好奇，但带着些许失望地打开礼品盒，却发现里面是一本精美的精装本《圣经》，上面以金子凸印着年轻人的名字。看罢，年轻人怒气冲冲地向父亲大喊道：“你有那么多钱，却只给我一本《圣经》？”说完，便丢下《圣经》，愤怒地冲出房子。\nMany years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family, but realizing his father was very old, he thought perhaps he should go to see him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Before he could make the arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away, and willed all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care of things.\n多年以后，年轻人已事业有成。他拥有一所漂亮的房子，一个温馨的家庭。但当得知父亲年事已高，他想，或许应该去看看他。自从毕业那天起他就一直不见父亲。就在起程时，他收到一封电报－－父亲已逝世，并已立下遗嘱将其所有财产转给儿子。他要立即回父亲家处理后事。\nWhen he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father's important papers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn the pages. As he was reading, a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealer who had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words... "PAID IN FULL".\n在父亲的房子里，他突然内心感到一阵悲伤与懊悔。他开始仔细搜寻父亲的重要文件，突然发现了那本《圣经》－－还跟几年前一样崭新。他噙着泪水打开《圣经》并一页一页地阅读着。忽然，从书的背面掉出一把钥匙。钥匙上挂着一个标签，上面写着一个汽车经销商的名字－－正是他曾渴望的那辆跑车的经销商。标签上还有他的毕业日期及“款已付清”的字样。\nHow many times do we miss blessings because they are not packaged as we expected? I trust you enjoyed this. Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.\n我们多少次地与祝福擦肩而过，仅仅因为他们没有按我们想象中的样子包装好？我相信你也有这样的经历。不要在渴望得到没有的东西时损坏你已经拥有的东西，但要记住一点：你现在所拥有的恰恰正是你曾经一心渴望得到的。\nSometimes we don't realize the good fortune we have or we could have because we expect "the packaging" to be different. What may appear as bad fortune may in fact be the door that is just waiting to be opened.\n有时，我们并没有意识到我们已经拥有或本该拥有的好运，仅仅因为它的外表与我们想象中的有所不同。其实，表面上看起来像是坏运气的东西或许正是等待开启的幸运之门.

        <description>
            The continuing government shutdown in the United States is now in its 22nd day, the longest in US history. President Trump is refusing to sign budget measures to reopen parts of the government because Democrats in Congress won't include funding for his promised border wall with Mexico.

        <markdown-content>Hello, This is David Austin with the BBC News. The continuing government shutdown in the United States is now in its 22nd day, the longest in US history. President Trump is refusing to sign budget measures to reopen parts of the government because Democrats in Congress won't include funding for his promised border wall with Mexico. Here's David Willis. Hundreds of thousands of government workers have now missed out on what should have been their first paycheck of the year, and with airport screening staff, air traffic controllers and FBI officers among those who are affected, union officials are warning that public safety could be compromised if the shutdown drags on. Despite calls by the president for Democrats to negotiate, no further talks between the two sides are planned.\nThe White House has dismissed this absurd report by the New York Times, saying that FBI opened an inquiry into whether President Trump was working secretly on behalf of Russia. Here's Michael Duncan. These allegations go much further than mere collusion between the Russians and the Trump election campaign. The report in the New York Times says that the officials were so concerned that the FBI began an investigation into whether Mr. Trump was in fact working on behalf of Russia and constituted a threat to US national security. Days later, that counter-intelligence inquiry became part of Robert Mueller's investigation, which has yet to publish its conclusions. Mr. Trump's Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed the report as absurd. She said James Comey was sacked because he was a disgraced partisan hack and his deputy Andrew McCabe, who launched the inquiry was a known liar who had been dismissed by the FBI.\nA British cabinet minister has warned that there could be a surge in far-right extremism in the UK if Brexit is blocked. The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told the Daily Mail newspaper that if Britain's departure is prevented, the seventeen million people who voted for Brexist will feel cheated. Mr. Grayling endorses the Prime Minister's withdrawal deal, which faces likely defeat next week in Parliament. Chris Mason reports. Chris Grayling is not suggesting there would be riots if Brexit is weakened or reversed, but he is blunt about what he fears would be the consequences. People should not underestimate this, he says, we would see a different tone in our politics, a less tolerant society, a more nationalistic nation. He then adds, if MPs who represent seats that voted 70% to leave say sorry, guys we are still going to have freedom of movement, they will turn against the political mainstream. BBC News.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是大卫·奥斯汀，欢迎收听BBC新闻。美国政府停摆现已延续了22天，达到了美国历史上时间最长的一次。特朗普拒绝签署预算措施以重启部分政府，因为国会的民主党不愿意为特朗普承诺的美墨边境墙拨款。以下是大卫·威利斯的报道。几十万名政府工作人员现已错过了他们新年的第一笔薪水，机场安检人员，交通管制人员以及FBI人员都在受影响之列，工会官员警告称如果停摆继续下去将会危及公共安全。尽管总统呼吁与民主党进行磋商，但双方没有计划进一步会谈。\n白宫没有理会《纽约时报》的一份荒唐报告，该报告称FBI曾进行过一项关于特朗普是否秘密地为俄罗斯工作的调查。这些指控要比特朗普涉嫌在竞选活动中通俄严重的多。引起美国官员担忧的《纽约时报》的报道称，FBI曾进行过一项调查，目的在于查清特朗普是否真的为俄罗斯工作，以及是否对美国国家安全造成威胁。几天之后，罗伯特·穆勒就开启了反情报调查，但现在还没有公布结论。特朗普的新闻发言人萨拉·哈科比·桑德斯否认了该报道，并称其荒唐可笑。她表示詹姆斯·科米被解雇是因为他是一个可耻的党派黑客，发起这项调查的副局长麦凯布则被公认为是一个骗子，也被FBI所辞退。\n英国一名内阁大臣警告称，英国脱欧如果失败则可能会导致极右极端主义的暴增。交通大臣克里斯·格雷灵告诉《每日邮报》称如果英国脱欧失败，一千七百万支持脱欧的民众将会感觉收到了欺骗。格雷灵支持首相的脱欧协议，但是该协议有可能会在下周的国会中被否决。以下是克里斯·梅森的报道。克里斯·格雷灵的意思并不是如果脱欧受阻或是失败就会引起暴动，但是他也明确表示这也是他所担心的后果。他表示，人们不能低估这件事，如果脱欧失败，我们的政治将会有更多的反对声音，社会也将变得不宽容，国家也会更具民族主义。他之后补充道，如果70%同意脱欧的国会议员说不好意思，我们仍可以自由移动，民众将会转而反对主流政治。BBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Jonathan Izard. The British Prime Minister Theresa May has warned that failing to ensure the country leaves the EU would be a catastrophic and unforgivable breach of trust in British democracy. Just two days before a crucial parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal that she is expected to lose, Mrs. May has written in a newspaper article that MPs must not let the people down. Chris Mason reports from Westminster. We stand at the start of a momentous week at Westminster. The government is just a few days away from a widely expected defeat over its Brexit plan and the stakes already towering have grown higher. The Sunday Times reveals the government fears losing its ability to govern in the event of defeat on Tuesday. Its advisers have warned that back benches could seize control of Parliamentary business and so for instance legally compel the government to request that Brexit is delayed. Rarely in recent times has had been so much uncertainty about the government and the country's future.\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has urged South African men to unite against what he described as a national crisis of violence against women. He was launching an election manifesto for the governing ANC in the port city of Durban. Andrew Harding reports. President Cyril Ramaphosa urged every man in Durban's packed stadium to stand and they did. He said women were being raped and killed on a continuous basis in South Africa. It was a national crisis, he said, and we must pledge to end it. It was a passionate and unexpected moment. Forty thousand rapes are reported here every year, almost certainly a fraction of the real total. And President Ramaphosa said it was time South Africa took steps to ensure that it was no longer defined by the crisis of gender-based violence.\nJulian Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio in Texas has launched his bid for the US presidency in 2020. The 44-year-old joins Tulsi Gabbard and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney in the race for the Democratic nomination. David Willis in Washington has more details. He gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention four years ago and was the youngest member of Barack Obama's cabinet. More than anything else, he's looking to become America's first hispanic president and it's a real American dream story. And he, Mr. Castro said today that his grandmother Victoria, who came to the United States from Mexico nearly a century ago would have been amazed to know that one of her grandchildren would end up a member of the US congress. The other would end up running for president. This is the world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n欢迎收听BBC新闻，大家好，我是乔纳森·伊泽德。英国首相特蕾莎·梅警告称脱欧失败将会对英国民主制度信任度造成灾难性和不可原谅的破坏。两天之后，国会将会对她的脱欧协议进行投票，预计她将会输掉。梅在一篇报纸文章中写到，议员绝对不能让人们失望。以下是克里斯·梅森从威斯敏斯特发来的报道。在威斯敏斯特，至关重要的一周即将开启。大部分人预计几天之后政府的脱欧计划将面临失败，原本失败几率很高的计划还在不断增加。《星期日泰晤士报》表示政府害怕在周二的落败中失去执政的机会。其顾问警告称普通议员可能会夺取议会的控制权，并将合法强迫政府推迟脱欧计划。最近几次关于政府和国家的未来充满了不确定性，这是很罕见的。\n总统西里尔·拉马福萨要求南非人民团结起来应对针对女性的全国性暴力危机。他在港口城市德班对执政的“南非非洲人国民大会”发起了一项竞选宣言。以下是安德鲁·哈丁的报道。总统西里尔·拉马福萨要求德班体育场的人全体起立，人们纷纷响应。他表示在南非不断地有女性被强奸的和杀害。他表示，这已经成为了国家危机，我们必须保证结束它。这一刻人们情绪激动也出人意料。南非每年报告的强奸案例达4万多起，这也占据全国女性总数很大一部分。总统拉马福萨表示，南非是时候该采取措施彻底结束这场性别暴力危机了。\n前德克萨斯州圣安东尼奥的市长朱利安·卡斯特罗拉开2020竞选大幕。44岁的卡斯特罗将与图尔西·加伯德，以及前马里兰岛国会议员约翰·德莱尼参加民主党的提名竞选。以下是大卫·威利斯在华盛顿的详细报道。他曾在四年前的民主党全国代表大会发表了演讲，也是巴拉克·奥巴马内阁中最年轻的成员。他现在最想做的就是成为美国第一位西班牙裔总统，而这也是一个真实的美国梦的故事。卡斯特罗表示他的祖母维多利亚一个世纪之前从墨西哥来到美国，如果她还活着也会为她的孙辈感到惊讶，因为他们一人当上了美国议员，另一人正在竞选美国总统。BBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News.\nTurkey has responded angrily to President Trump's threat to devastate the country economically if it attacks Kurdish forces in Syria after US troops pull out. But Mr. Trump also asked Kurdish groups who are regarded by Ankara as terrorists not to provoke Turkey. More from Barbara Plett Usher.\nMr. Trump has threatened Turkey with devastating its economy if the Turks attacked these Kurds after the Americans leave and now the Turkish President has responded and he's said, you know, we expect you to behave like a strategic partner. You cannot equate terrorists with partners. In the meantime, Mr. Trump has actually given away a few details about this troop withdrawal. He talked about a twenty-mile safe zone presumably along the border between Turkey and northern Syria. He also said if Islamic State militants come back in Syria, we can always attack them from a nearby military base, responding to criticism that the US is retreating and allowing a situation where Islamic State can regroup.\nIndonesian officials say they have recovered the cockpit voice recorder from a Lion airplane that crashed into the Java Sea in October. Reports say it was found eight meters deep under mud on the seafloor. Officials say human remains were also discovered. Rebecca Henschke reports.\nThe budget airline flight lost contact shortly after takeoff from Jakarta airport and crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 189 people on board. Investigators have said in their early reports that the plane, a nearly brand new Boeing 737 MAX 8 had technical problems. And some families of the victims have started legal action against Boeing.\nThe head of a South Korean animal rescue organization CARE is under pressure to resign after a whistleblower accused her of secretly instructing her staff to euthanize dozens of stray dogs. More details now from Celia Hatton.\nOne of CARE's former employees said the organization had been covering up its real stance on animal euthanasia, charging the CARE CEO Park So-yeon had lied about killing more than two hundred dogs due to the organization's public stance against the practice. Ms. Park reportedly told the charity supporters some of the animals that had actually been killed had instead been adopted in order to encourage donations. CARE has said that a small number of dogs were euthanized, mostly because of illness and had tried its best to respond to what it said was an overwhelming number of requests to save animals.\nBBC world news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼尔·努内斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n特朗普威胁称，如果土耳其在美国撤军后袭击库尔德武装，就会在经济上摧毁土耳其，土耳其对此作出了愤怒的回应。但特朗普也要求被土耳其视为恐怖分子的库尔德武装不要挑衅土耳其。以下是芭芭拉·普莱特-亚瑟的报道。\n特朗普威胁称如果美国撤军后土耳其袭击库尔德武装，美国将会摧毁其国内经济；土耳其总统回应称我们把你当作战略伙伴，你不能把恐怖分子也当作伙伴。同时，特朗普也给出了一些撤军的详细信息。他谈到可能要在土耳其和叙利亚北部之间建立一个20公里的安全区。他表示如果伊斯兰国组织武装从叙利亚返回，美国可以从附近的军事基地赶来对抗他们，这也是特朗普对美国撤军和任由伊斯兰国组织复苏的批评做出的回应。\n印度尼西亚官方表示他们已经找到了去年10月坠入爪洼海的狮航客机驾驶舱上的语音记录器。报道称，这个记录器在海床下8米深的淤泥中被找到。官员表示他们也找到了遇难者的遗体。以下是蕾贝卡·亨施客的报道。\n该趟廉价航班从雅加达机场起飞后不久失联，并坠入爪洼海，机上189人全部遇难。调查人员在早期报告中称这架近乎全新的波音737 MAX 8飞机存在技术问题。一些遇难人员家属已经对波音公司提起法律诉讼。\n韩国动物营救组织CARE的负责人正面临着辞职的压力，因为有告密者指控她秘密地让员工对数十条流浪犬实施安乐死。以下是西利亚·哈顿的报道。\nCARE的一名前员工称该组织一直都在掩盖对于动物实施安乐死的真实立场，并指控其CEO朴素妍掩盖了杀死200条狗的事实，因为对动物实施安乐死与该组织的公开立场相背。据报道，朴素妍告诉慈善组织支持者们，这些实际上已经被杀的动物都被人领养了，以此鼓励捐赠。CARE表示一小部分狗被安乐死了，大多是因为生病，并且他们已经应人们的要求尽最大努力去拯救动物了。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>I'm Stuart Mackintosh with the BBC News. Hello. Britain's Prime Minister is facing defeat later in a parliamentary vote on her proposed terms for the country's departure from the European Union. The vote comes more than two and a half years after a referendum in which British voters opted to leave the EU. The government's opponents argue the withdrawal deal is legally and constitutionally unsound. Here's our political correspondent Ian Watson. To say this is a big day for Prime Minister would be a huge understatement. Everyone keeps talking about the worst, which is hard since well last week, but this time she is on a verge of suffering potentially a major defeat on a deal she's negotiated with the EU. More than a hundred of MPs are still saying they cannot support it. We'll see if she can bring those numbers down today. There'll be various changes proposed to her deal which might make it look a bit more attractive. But as things stand, it looks as though the Prime Minister will not be able to get enough support to get a deal through parliament.\nA senior member of the Afghan Taliban has been detained in Pakistan. Taliban sources said the man held is Hafiz Mohibullah, the Religious Affairs Minister in the Taliban administration in Afghanistan before 2001. Our Pakistan correspondent Secunder Kermani has more details. He had been living in the northern Pakistani city of Peshawar for a number of years, but he was detained by Pakistani authorities in the past few days. And now our sources, the senior Taliban figures speaking to us on condition of anonymity, has said that this move is part of a strategy by Pakistan to pressurize the Taliban into taking part in peace talks with US officials which they have already been doing it in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but also crucially taking part in peace talks with the Afghan government who so far the Taliban have refused to meet because they dismissed them as puppets.\nThe Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is due to sign a decree today loosening the country's gun laws. Mr. Bolsonaro who took office earlier this month, made the pledge a key part of his presidential campaign. Candace Piette reports. Brazilians are desperate for better public security. In 2017, almost 64,000 people were murdered, two thirds died from gunshot wounds. But the latest polls say most Brazilians believe making firearms more available will pour gas on a raging fire. That hasn't stopped President Bolsonaro who says that by freeing up the existing gun laws, he can reduce crime. As a first step, Brazilians will only have to renew their gun license every ten years instead of five. They also won't have to work so hard to convince the police they need a firearm. BBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是斯图尔特·麦金托什，欢迎收听BBC新闻。英国首相的脱欧计划面临着在议会投票中失败的危险。两年半之前，英国举行全民公投，英国公民选择了离开欧盟。政府反对党认为该脱欧方案在法律上和宪法上都是不稳妥的，以下是本台政治通讯员伊恩·华生的报道。首相今天将会面临一个巨大的考验，这么说有点轻描淡写。从上周开始每个人都在讨论着最坏的结果，而现在她濒临遭受一场重大协议失败，她曾与欧盟商讨该协议。一百多名议员仍表示他们不会支持该方案。今天她是否能减少反对者的人数，我们拭目以待。她的方案还会有多项修改提议，这也许让它看起来更有吸引力。从目前的情况来看，首相将不会得到足够的支持让这份方案从国会通过。\n一名阿富汗塔利班高级成员在巴基斯坦被捕。塔利班消息人员称哈菲兹·穆哈卜拉是阿富汗塔利班政府2001年之前的宗教事务部长。以下是本台巴基斯坦通讯员赛康德·科芒尼的报道。他在巴基斯坦北部城市白沙瓦生活了数年，但是在几天前被巴基斯坦政府拘捕。我们的消息人士，匿名塔利班高级官员告诉我们称，巴基斯坦此举是在向塔利班施压，让他们加入到与美国官员的和平谈判中来，在卡塔尔和阿联酋他们已经开始了和平谈判。另外，这也是在迫使塔利班与阿富汗政府进行和平谈判，但是目前为止塔利班都拒绝与其会谈，因为他们认为阿富汗政府就是傀儡。\n巴西总统雅伊尔·博索纳罗今天将会签署一项法令，放宽该国的枪支管制。博索纳罗本月初上台，这项措施就是他的总统竞选时的重要承诺。以下是坎迪斯·皮尔特的报道。巴西民众正渴求一个更好的公共安全环境。2017年，大约有64000人被谋杀，三分之二死于枪伤。最新的民调显示大多数的巴西人认为放宽枪支管控无异于火上浇油。但这并没有阻止总统博索纳罗签署该法令，他表示通过放宽现行的枪支法规，可以减少犯罪。作为第一步，巴西民众未来只需每隔10年更新枪支执照，之前为5年。而且现在他们可以更加容易地说服警察他们需要一把枪。BBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>**A Gift of Love**\n**爱的礼物**\n"Can I see my baby?" the happy new mother asked.\n“我可以看看我的宝宝吗？”初为人母的她开心地问道。\nWhen the bundle was nestled in her arms and she moved the fold of cloth to look upon his tiny face, she gasped. The doctor turned quickly and looked out the tall hospital window. The baby had been born without ears.\n当裹着的婴儿放到她臂弯里，她掀开裹着婴儿的布，在看到他的小脸时，她不禁倒吸了一口气。医生快速地转过身，透过医院的高层窗户向外看去。婴儿生下来就没有耳朵。\nTime proved that the baby's hearing was perfect. It was only his appearance that was marred. When he rushed home from school one day and flung himself into his mother's arms, she sighed, knowing that his life was to be a succession of heartbreaks.\n时间证明婴儿的听力毫无问题，只是有损他的相貌。一天，当他匆匆从学校跑回家，扑向母亲的怀抱时，她叹了口气，意识到他的生活注定会受到一连串的打击。\nHe blurted out the tragedy. "A boy, a big boy...called me a freak."\n他脱口诉说遭到的不幸：“一个男孩，一个大个子男孩……他喊我怪胎。”\nHe grew up, handsome except for his misfortune. A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president, but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music.\n他长大了，虽然不幸但还是长得挺帅。颇受同学的欢迎，要不是有缺陷，他很可能当了班长。他对文学和音乐很有天赋和潜质。\nBut you might mingle with other young people, his mother reproved him, but felt a kindness in her heart.\n“但你可能会和其他年轻人一样。”母亲责备地说，但从心底里觉得很欣慰。\nThe boy's father had a session with the family physician... "Could nothing be done?"\n男孩的父亲与家庭医生商量……“难道真无法补救吗？”\nI believe I could graft on a pair of outer ears, if they could be procured, the doctor decided. So the search began for a person who would make such a sacrifice for a young man.\n“我认为可以移植一双外耳，如果能够找到的话。”医生做了决定，于是他们开始寻求一个愿意为这个年轻人做出牺牲的人。\nTwo years went by.Then, "You're going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But it's a secret." said the father.\n两年过去了。对儿子说，“孩子，你要住院了。我和你妈找到愿意为你捐献耳朵的人了。但要求保密。”\nThe operation was a brilliant success, and a new person emerged. His talents blossomed into genius, and school and college became a series of triumphs.\n手术获得了巨大成功，一个新人诞生了。他的潜力发展成一个天才，在中学和大学都取得了一连串的成功。\nLater he married and entered the diplomatic service. "but I must know," he asked his father, "Who gave me the ears? Who gave me so much? I could never do enough for him."\n后来他结婚了，进入外交行业工作。一天，他问父亲：“是谁给我的耳朵？谁给了我那么多？我做多少都无法报答他/她。”\nI do not believe you could, said the father, "but the agreement was that you are not to know...not yet."\n“我也这样认为，”父亲说，“但是协议上说你不能知道……还不到时候。”\nThe years kept their profound secret, but the day did come. One of the darkest days that ever pass through a son. He stood with his father over his mother's casket. Slowly, tenderly, the father stretched forth a hand and raised the thick, reddish brown hair to reveal that the mother had no outer ears.\n他们的秘密遵守了很多年，但这天终于来了，这也是儿子度过的最黑暗的日子。他和父亲站在母亲的棺材前，慢慢地，轻柔地，父亲向前伸出一只手，掀开母亲浓密的、红褐色的头发：母亲竟然没有耳朵！\n"Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut," he whispered gently, "and nobody ever thought mother less beautiful, did they?"\n“你母亲说过她很高兴，她从不理发，”父亲轻柔地低声说，“但没人觉得母亲没以前美丽，是吧？”

        <markdown-content>BBC news with Julie Candler.\nPresident Trump will hold a second summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un near the end of February. It's expected to focus on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The White House didn't say anything about how to advance the nuclear talks that have made very little progress since the first summit last year.\nThe White House has condemned the categorically false allegations that President Trump ordered his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to congress about his business links with Russia before he took office. If substantiated, the allegations could trigger impeachment proceedings. Mr. Trump's current lawyer has denied the claims.\nThe U.S. government has confirmed that an American-born Iranian journalist has been detained since Sunday as a material witness in an undisclosed federal investigation. A federal court order said Marzieh Hashemi is expected to be released after she testifies before a grand jury.\nThe rights group Amnesty International says its analysis of satellite imagery of the town of Rann in northwest Nigeria reveals extensive destruction following an attack by Boko Haram militants on Monday. Amnesty said the images confirmed previous descriptions of the town as like a graveyard.\nPolice in the Sudanese capital Khartoum have opened fire at mourners attending the funeral of a man killed during clashes with the security forces.

        <markdown-content>I'm Rosemary Crick with the BBC News. Hello. At least 21 people have been killed and more than seventy injured in a huge explosion at a leaking oil pipeline in central Mexico. Hundreds of people were scrambling to steal some of the fuel when they were engulfed in flames. Electra Nasmyth reports. The blast happened near the Tula refinery in Hidalgo state. Video footage showed a huge fireball and desperate people running away from the flames. One man described having to claw his way through charred bodies as he tried to help. The state oil company Pemex blamed on illegal fuel tap for the fire, a dangerous but highly profitable business which the government says caused Mexico three billion dollars last year. The Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced a major crackdown in December but the controvertial plan has led to feul shortages and long lines at petrol stations in some states.\nThe office of the US Special Counsel Robert Mueller has disputed the accuracy of a news report that President Trump ordered his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed News has said that Mr. Trump instructed Mr. Cohen to lie about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Buzzfeed said it stood by its report. David Willis reports. Another roller coaster week for the president ended with claims that he may have sought to obstruct justice. An impeachable offense if true, but true, it may not be. The White House flatly denied the claim, and later it emerged that the Special Counsel who is investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia didn't buy it either. Buzzfeed's description of specific statements to the Special Council's office are not accurate read a statement. President Trump was clearly ecstatic. Last night, he tweeted "a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country".\nThe partial shutdown of the US government has entered its fifth week with Donald Trump saying he'll make what he described as a major announcement on Saturday. Reports from Washington suggest that senior officials, including the Vice President Mike Pence, have come up with new proposals to resolve the crisis.\nThe government of Burkina Faso has unexpectedly resigned. No explanation was given. But the tiny west African nation has been hit by a wave of Jihadi's attacks and kidnappings of foreigners, including a Canadian geologist who was found dead earlier this week.\nFor the first time, officials in Pakistan have briefed parliament on the country's growing export of human hair. A statement by the Commerce Ministry said Pakistan earned 1.6 million dollars from the sale of hair in the last five years. China, which has an expanding beauty industry, was one of the main buyers taking more than a hundred thousand kilos of hair from Pakistan.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Eileen McHugh with the BBC News. The Constitutional Court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has officially declared the opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi, the winner of last month's presidential election. It rejected an appeal by another opposition candidate Martin Fayulu who's accused Mr. Tshisekedi and the outgoing president of striking a deal. Mr. Fayulu insists he is the only legitimate president of Congo. I call on the whole international community to not recognize a power that has neither legitimacy nor legal quality to represent the Congolese people. Dear compatriots, I launch an urgent appeal to our people so that they take charge and organize peaceful demonstrations across the whole of the national territory in order to defend its sovereignty.\nDemocrats in the US Congress have dismissed a proposal by President Trump on immigration policy, which aims to end the partial shutdown of the US government. Mr. Trump offered what he called a compromise in return for funding his border wall with Mexico, but the Democrats say President Trump is only giving back what he had earlier taken away. From Washington, here's David Willis. Senior Democrats find the very notion of a wall repugnance and believe the president is holding government workers' hostage in a desperate bid to make good on a central promise of his campaign. They declared his new offer a nonstarter and continue to insist that only once the government is reopened will they discuss border security. Where the dispute goes from here is anyone's guess, but White House officials are not ruling out the possibility that the president could walk away from the negotiations and circumvent Congress by declaring a national emergency.\nOne of India's most senior politicians Amit Shah, the president of the governing party BJP has been released from hospital in the capital Delhi after being treated for swine flu. Our South Asia editor Jill McGivering reports. Amit Shah is one of the closest aides of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and seen as a key architect of his campaign to be reelected. So there's been a particular focus on his health when he was treated for swine flu in one of the country's top hospitals. Now he says he's made a full recovery. In recent years, India has seen a series of outbreaks of the virus which is highly contagious and can be fatal. Already this month, almost fifty people have died in Rajasthan and more than a thousand tested positive. Jill McGivering.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Eileen McKue with the BBC News.\nSouth Africa has disclosed that it turned down a request from Zimbabwe for an emergency loan of 1.2 billion dollars in December. Soon after the request was rejected, the Zimbabwean government was forced to announce a steep increase in the price of fuel, sparking angry protest. Perm Zufanany reports from Johannesburg.\nAsked whether loan was turned down, Treasury spokesperson Jabulani Sikhakhane told the BBC Zimbabwe is in a dire financial situation, but South Africa does not have that kind of money. It is believed that Zimbabwe had hoped to use the cash injection to stabilize the ailing economy and resolve fuel shortages in the country. President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced a drastic fuel hike last week, leading to widespread and violent protest which saw at least 12 people killed in clashes with security forces.\nIsrael has announced that it struck a number of sites inside Syria as part of its increasingly open effort to dislodge Iranian forces there. The Russian Defense Ministry says four Syrian soldiers were killed, but monitors based in Britain say eleven people died in the attack. Israel said it was responding to Iranian rocket fire which intercepted on Sunday.\nEuropean Foreign Ministers are expected to impose sanctions today on two Russian military intelligence officers blamed by the West for a nerve agent attack in the British city of Salisbury last year. They're among nine people facing new EU penalties for using chemical weapons in breach of international treaties.\nEU Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels have said it's up to Britain to decide what it wants to do next about Brexit, as the British Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to address parliament again. The Spanish Foreign Minister said she needed to come up with something substantially different to secure the backing of the British parliament. But our correspondent Rob Watson says Mrs. May's plan appears not to have deviated.\nI think people would say rather cynically that her hope is what it has been all along, but essentially those on the hard right of the Conservative Party enthusiastic about Brexit will be incredibly frightened about all this talk of efforts to stop Brexit or put a delay on it or have some other option and that those who are on the remain side of the Conservative Party will be utterly terrified at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit all together. So I think in many ways her plan hasn't changed very much and I don't think her tactics have changed very much. Now whether they'll work is an entirely different matter. Rob Watson reporting.\nThat's the latest BBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是艾琳·麦克尤，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n南非披露称在12月拒绝了津巴布韦12亿美元的紧急贷款请求。请求遭拒后，津巴布韦政府被迫宣布大幅度上调燃油价格，这也导致了愤怒的抗议活动。以下是本·兰尼在约翰内斯堡的报道。\n当被问及贷款是否被拒后，财政部发言人亚布拉尼·斯卡哈尼告诉BBC称津巴布韦财政状况十分严峻，但是南非并没有那么多钱可供贷款。据称，津巴布韦曾希望用注入资金的方式来稳定国内病态的经济，解决国内的燃油短缺问题。上周埃默森·姆南加古瓦总统宣布大幅上调燃油价格，导致了大范围的暴力抗议活动，至少有12人在与安全部队的冲突中死亡。\n以色列宣布他们打击了叙利亚境内的多个目标地点，这是他们加大力度驱逐当地的伊朗武装计划的一部分。俄罗斯国防部表示有四名叙利亚士兵死亡，而驻英国的观察机构则表示有11人在袭击中丧生。以色列表示伊朗周日对其进行了火箭弹袭击，但被拦截，而这是对该袭击的反击。\n欧洲国家外交部长将于今天对两名俄罗斯军事情报人员实施制裁，西方国家指控他们去年用神经毒素袭击了英国城市索尔兹伯里。因违反国际条约使用化学武器，包括他们在内的9名人员将面临新的欧盟处罚。\n在布鲁塞尔会面的欧盟各国外交部长称接下来脱欧如何进行将由英国决定，英国首相特蕾莎·梅准备再次向国会发表讲话。西班牙外交部长表示她需要想出一个有本质上区别的方案来确保得到英国议会的支持。但我台记者罗勃·华生表示梅的计划似乎没有改变。\n我认为人们一都对特蕾莎·梅的希望持以讽刺，但本质上那些对脱欧保持乐观的保守党极右翼分子将非常害怕脱欧计划停止，或是被推迟，抑或是出现别的选择，保守党中剩下的一部分人将会非常害怕无协议脱欧的出现。所以，我认为她的计划在很多方面来说都没有太多的改变，并且我认为她的战略也没有太大的变动。现在，这些能否起作用都是另一回事了。罗勃·华生报道。\n以上就是最新的BBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Chris Barrow with the BBC News. The President of Zimbabwe Emmerson Mnangagwa has returned home after breaking off from a foreign tour to address days of violent protests. He said chaos and insubordination would not be tolerated. Andrew Harding is in Harare. Mixed message from Mnangagwa. I think it was inevitable that he was gonna condemn the protesters. What I think was most surprising and interesting was quite how tough he was on his own security forces. These of course the men in the military, the police who staged the coup that brought the president to power that ousted Robert Mugabe more than a year ago. He basically warned them that if they were using indiscriminate violence that will be a betrayal, he said, of the new Zimbabwe and that heads would roll. Some people here are speculating that there are plots against Mr. Mnangagwa that perhaps a new coup is in the offing and Mnangagwa was taking a bit of a risk threatening them so publicly.\nA former US Marine arrested in Russia on suspicion of spying is appearing in court in Moscow. Paul Whelan is appealing against the decision to refuse him bail while he awaits trial. He was detained by Russian security agents late last month, allegedly as he received state secrets. Mr. Whelan insists he is innocent. The case has prompted speculation that Mr. Whelan may have been arrested in order to swap him for Russian citizens in the United States. Moscow denies this.\nActivists in Pakistan say a leader of an ethnic Pashtun Movement campaigning against enforced disappearances has been arrested on terrorism charges. Here is Anbarasan Ethirajan. The arrest of Alamzeb Mehsud and other members of the Pashtun Protection Movement came two days after the group held a rally in the southern city of Karachi. Amnesty International has urged the Pakistani authorities either to bring Mr. Mehsud to court or release him immediately. The movement has shaken Pakistan's powerful military with this campaign to end alleged abuses by security forces targeting ethnic Pashtuns in the northwestern region.\nBritish members of Parliament are stepping up their efforts to influence the Brexit process before a key vote next week on a European Union withdrawal plan backed by the Prime Minister Theresa May. A number of amendments have been put forward, including some by the opposition Labor Party. Norman Smith reports. Supporters of another referendum have been buoyed by Labor's decision to include in its motion opposing Mrs. May's deal, a call for Parliament to have the option of a vote to trigger another referendum. Backers of a so called People's Vote have described it as a big step forward. Mr. Corbin's office, however, have been a good deal more circumspect, insisting it simply reflects the Party's existing policy.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Eileen McKue with the BBC News.\nThe sister of India's main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has formally joined politics months ahead of general elections. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been appointed as one of the General Secretaries of the Congress Party. Here's Yogata Lemoye.\nWith just months to go for the national election, Ms Gandhi's appointment is being seen as a major push by the Congress Party to try and win back power in India. In 2014, it's suffered a humiliating defeat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP party. Questions have often been raised about the popularity of the Congress' President Rahul who is Priyanka Gandhi's brother.

Andrew Harding is in Harare.\nA spokesman Nick Mangwana told the BBC that when things get out of hand, a bit of firmness is needed. The country's Human Rights Commission has accused the police and army of indiscriminate attacks on civilians as young as eleven. Soldiers in Harare were seen beating a large group of minibus drivers in the city on Tuesday evening. President Emmerson Mnangagwa's proposal of a national dialogue with opposition parties has been rejected by the MDC which insists that the authorities should first release several of its MPs and hundreds of civilians. The government says its tough economic reforms will continue, arguing that there can be no progress without pain. Some union leaders and human rights activists remain in hiding.\nRussia has given foreign military attaches a briefing on a contentious new missile system, and it again insisted it's in full compliance with a key arms control treaty dating back to the Cold War. The United States says it will pull out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty unless Russia destroys the missiles as they breach its terms.\nThe authorities in Ethiopia have arrested a former government minister on suspicion of embezzlement. Bereket Simon, a close ally of the former Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was detained at his home early on Wednesday as well as the former head of a state-own company.

        <markdown-content>BBC news with Maria Marshall.\nThe United States has recognized its interim president of Venezuela, the head of the opposition national assembly, Juan Guaido. President Trump said he will use the full weight of America's economic and diplomatic power to restore Venezuelan democracy. The announcement came minutes after Mr. Guaido declared himself interim president during widespread anti-government protests in Caracas. He claimed to have the support from military and promised free elections. Regional powers, such as Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru have also given their backing to Mr. Guaido. In his reaction, Venezuela's president Nicolas Maduro said he is breaking off diplomatic relations with Washington. A leading Maduro ally says Juan Guaido has violated Venezuela's constitution. And he doesn't care what U.S and other countries in the America say.

        <markdown-content>BBC News with Sue Montgomery. The five-week standoff between President Trump and the Democrats that led to the longest shutdown in US history has been resolved, at least for the moment. Mr. Trump has signed bipartisan bill to fund the US government for the next three weeks. He did so without securing the 5.7 billion dollars he wanted for a wall along the Mexican border. Chris Buckler reports. Most commentators believe Mr. Trump had to back down because he was being blamed in the polls for a dispute that led to workers queuing at food banks and planes being grounded because of a lack of air traffic control staff. The Minority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer insists Democrats will not agree to money for the wall. Shutting down the government over a policy difference is self-defeating. It accomplishes nothing but pain and suffering. President Trump is also considering the option of declaring a national emergency at the border with Mexico that could allow him to build the wall from other funds, although it would probably face a legal challenge.\nUp to three hundred people are missing and feared dead in Brazil after a dam collapsed at a mining complex in the state of Minas Gerais. Nine bodies have been recovered so far. Julia Carneiro reports. A sea of slides swept through a green rural area near the city of Brumadinho, swallowing everything in its track. It was a regular weekday with over four hundred workers busy at the local valley headquarters, many having lunch in the cafeteria which was buried. The government has set up the crisis cabinet and firefighters will continue rescue operations today.\nThe Czech tennis star Petra Kvitova is about to play for a first Grand Slam title since suffering hand injuries in a knife attack two years ago. She's facing Naomi Osaka of Japan in the Australian Open final in Melbourne. Here's Russell Fuller. Kvitova's surgeon feared she was unlikely to be able to compete at the highest level ever again. She underwent surgery in the Czech Republic in December 2016, just hours after an intruder had burst into her apartment and slashed all the fingers on her playing hand. Last year Kvitova won five tour titles and like Osaka, will also become the world number one if she triumphs on the Rod Laver Arena. Osaka's story is also a remarkable one. Her stunning victory over Serena Williams in Septembers's US Open final was overshadowed by the American's row with umpire Carlos Ramos. But if the 21-year-old wins in Melbourne, she'll be the first player for eighteen years to win a second Grand Slam title in the event immediately following her first.

Howard Johnson reports from Manila. The Defense Secretary of the Philippines Delfin Lorenzana issued a statement in which he strongly condemned the attack and urged the public to remain calm to deny terrorism a victory as he put it.

Announcing his defection from the government of Nicolas Maduro, the defense attache Colonel Jose Luis Silva called for fresh elections. He urged what he called his brothers in the armed forces to help restore democracy. Today, I speak to the people of Venezuela, and especially to my brothers in the armed forces of the nation to recognize President Juan Guaido as the only legitimate president. This is all based on the constitution of our Republic that states that no person or institution can be above it.\nRescue teams in Brazil are restarting their search for survivors after a dam collapsed on Friday, unleashing a torrent of mud and industrial waste. Thirty four people are confirmed to have died. Fifty people were pulled alive from the sludge on Saturday before the rescue operation was paused overnight.

The dam is owned by Brazil's largest mining company Vale.\nThe American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has welcomed what he called encouraging news from talks between the US envoy and the Afghan Taliban.

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC News.\nThe United Nation says the humanitarian situation in Yemen is now deeply precarious, and any further destabilization could provoke a famine. The warning from the UN's World Food Program comes as pressure mounts on a month-old ceasefire in the port city of Hodeida, which is a vital gateway for aid supplies to Yemen. In the last few days, a wheat storage facility and a camp for displaced people have come under fire. The UN humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande told the BBC that the food situation across the country remain desperate.\nThere are twenty million people in this country who don't know if they're gonna eat today. Two hundred and thirty-eight thousand people are as we speak, starving. We can't describe this crisis more starkly and this is why humanitarians across the country are insisting that everybody do everything possible to end this conflict. The time has come.\nInvestigators say the captain of a Bangladeshi aircraft which crashed at Kathmandu airport last March was under stress and emotionally disturbed during the flight. All four crew members and forty-seven out of sixty-seven passengers died after the US-Bangla Airline flight crashed. Here is Jill McGivering.\nThe investigator's report suggests the captain was extremely upset during the short flight. He was irritable, tense, moody and aggressive at various times. He said I'm tired because he's slept poor the previous night. He talked obsessively to his young copilot about a colleague's criticism of his performance as a trainer which deeply upset him and his plans to resign. As the plane came into land, his behavior was impulsive and inappropriate, it's said, and he made a series of mistakes which proved fatal for so many of those on board.\nPolice in southern Mexico say at least ten people have been killed in a shoot-out between two local armed groups. The security spokesman in the state of Guerrero said the gun fight took place on a highway in the town of Chilapa had lasted for three hours. Witnesses said the gun fight started when an armed gang attempted to drive through districts controlled by another local militia.\nA powerful tornado has hit Cuba's capital Havana, killing at least three people.

        <markdown-content>BBC News. Hello, I'm Gareth Barlow.\nThe Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described as criminal sanctions imposed on the state owned oil company PDVSA by the United States. He accused Washington of setting out to steal the firm's US space of subsidiary Citgo and said PDVSA would take legal action to protect its asset. The sanctions were announced by the US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington earlier. From where Barbara Plett-Usher reports.\nThis is a critical economic move because Venezuela's oil sales to the United States are a big source of cash revenue for the Maduro government. The sanctions bar Americans from doing business with the state oil company and freeze any assets it has in the US. This is also an attempt to boost Mr. Maduro's rival, the opposition leader Juan Guaido. The Trump administration recognized him last week as Venezuela's leader. The aim is to transfer the oil money to him and the country's national assembly. As the announcement was made, Mr. Guaido said he was taking control of Venezuela's assets abroad to prevent Mr. Maduro from seizing them if he left power.\nProtesters have gathered outside the offices of the Brazilian mining company Vale as rescuers continue a desperate search for survivors from Friday's dam collapse. The firm's share price plunged by nearly twenty-five percent on Monday on the Brazilian stock market. Sixty-five people are so far confirmed dead.\nThe Supreme Court in Pakistan is due to hear a final legal challenge to the acquittal of a Christian woman who'd been sentenced to death for blasphemy. Secunder Kermani reports.\nAsia Bibi was convicted of insulting the prophet Muhammad in 2010 following an argument with two Muslim women who refuse to drink water from the same cup as her was working in a field. Two politicians who spoke out in her defence were murdered by militants, and the decision to quash her sentence last year resulted in angry protests. But the leaders of that unrest are currently in jail and it's expected if her acquittal is upheld, that Asia Bibi will be granted asylum abroad.\nMexico's largest railway operator has warned that the country could face shortages of staple foods as a result of a two-week protest by teachers been blocking train tracks in the west of the country. Kyle Winer reports.\nA spokeswoman for the Ferromex railroad company told local media that more than three hundred trains have been cancelled since the teachers started camping on the tracks in Michoacan state in a protest over pay and conditions. She said their actions were limiting the distribution of foods including potatoes and corn flour round the country and preventing the delivery of essential supplies to the steel and car industries. Mexico's largest seaport is in Michoacann and shipping industry associations say at least ten thousand containers have been held up at a cost of over seven hundred million dollars to the economy.\nThat's the BBC news.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，大家好，我是加雷斯·巴洛。\n委内瑞拉总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗称美国对其国家石油公司PDVSA的制裁是一项犯罪行为。他指控美国设法窃取该公司的美国子公司雪铁戈石油公司，并表示委内瑞拉国家石油公司将会采取法律措施保护其资产。早前美国财政部长史蒂芬·努钦在华盛顿宣布了这些制裁。以下是芭芭拉·普莱特-亚瑟在华盛顿的报道。\n这是一个关键的金融举措，因为委内瑞拉对美国出售石油是马杜罗政府的主要现金收入来源。制裁禁止美国人与这家国有石油公司进行贸易，并且冻结了它在美国的所有资产。此举同样意在帮助马杜罗的政敌——反对党领袖胡安·瓜伊多。上周特朗普政府承认了他作为委内瑞拉领导人的身份。此举旨在将石油收入转移给他和该国的国民大会。随着这项措施的宣布，瓜伊多表示为了防止马杜罗下台后将其占为己有他将控制委内瑞拉在海外的资产。\n抗议者在巴西采矿公司清水河谷（Vale）的办公室外聚集，而救援人员还在竭尽全力搜救周五大坝倒塌事故中的幸存者。本周一，该公司在巴西股市中的股价暴跌近25%。目前已有65人确认死亡。\n巴基斯坦最高法院将审理赦免一名基督教女性的最终合法性问题，该女性因亵渎罪被判处死刑。以下是赛康德·科芒尼的报道。\n2010年阿西亚·比比因侮辱先知穆罕默德而被判有罪，原因是两名穆斯林女性拒绝和她同饮一个杯中的水而发生争执。为她辩护的两名政界人士遭到了武装分子的杀害，去年宣布的撤销判决的决定引起了愤怒的抗议活动。不过那场暴乱的领头人现已入狱，如果阿西亚·比比的无罪释放判决通过，她有望去国外寻求庇护。\n墨西哥最大的高速公路运营商警告称，国家可能面临主食短缺问题，因为一场由教师发起的持续了两个星期的抗议活动堵住了西部的铁路干线。以下是凯尔·维纳的报道。\n墨西哥Ferromex铁路公司的一名发言人告诉当地媒体，自从教师们在米却肯州的铁路上扎营抗议薪资和待遇问题以来，已有超过300列火车被取消。她表示他们的行为限制了包括土豆和玉米面粉在内的食物在全国范围内的分销，还阻碍了钢铁业和汽车制造业的关键材料的运输。墨西哥最大的海港就在米却肯州，航运业协会表示至少有一万只集装箱被滞留，造成经济损失超过7亿美元。\nBBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Marion Marshall with the BBC News. The former motor tycoon Carlos Ghosn has said the charges pressed against him by Japanese prosecutors are the result of a plot by Nissen executives, which he described as treason. The comment was in his first interview since being arrested in November. Celia Hatton reports. Speaking from a Tokyo detention center to Japan's Nikkei newspaper, the man who once headed three car companies, Carlos Ghosn, hit back against a mounting number of financial misconduct charges. Mr. Ghosn said that some in Nissan opposed his plan to integrate Renault, the French car company he headed, with its Japanese alliance partners Nissan and Mitsubishi. They wanted to get rid of him, he said. The former alliance had denied any wrongdoing, including underreporting his salary and using Nissan's money to cover personal investment losses. He said those decisions had been signed off by colleagues at Nissan.\nThe Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has said he's open to holding internationally mediated talks on the crisis in his country. He was speaking to Russia's state news agency. Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. This was a defiance, Nicolas Maduro speaking to the Russian news agency RIA, he insisted that his victory in elections last spring had been legitimate and transparent. He said if America and others wanted a fresh vote, then they'd have to wait to the end of his current term in 2025. But Nicolas Maduro also appeared to make a concession. He said he was ready to sit down for talks with the country's opposition for the sake of peace in the presence of international intermediaries. He was speaking ahead of a day of protests in Venezuela called by the opposition leader Juan Guaido, who's been recognized as the country's interim leader by the US and others.\nMore than four hundred schools in the Thai capital Bangkok have been ordered to close because of hazardous levels of smog. The governor of Bangkok said classes at all city-run schools were canceled for the rest of the week because of concerns for the health of students. The citie's pollution levels stood at about a hundred and seventy micrograms per cubic meter, which is considered unhealthy for everyone and particularly bad for children and the elderly.\nPolice in Australia say they intend to bring charges against one of the country's best known and most successful racehorse trainers. Darren Weir was arrested along with two other men during a raid at his stables in the state of Victoria as part of a corruption inquiry.

        <title>BBC News - Russia will follow US to suspend a key Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty</title>

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC News.\nPresident Putin has responded to a decision by the United States to suspend its participation in a key Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty by saying Russia will do the same. Our response will be a mirror one. Our American partners have announced they're suspending their participation in the treaty, and we are suspending ours, too. They have announced that they are engaged in research and development work, and we will do the same. At a meeting with his foreign and defense ministers, Mr. Putin said Russia would start to develop a new mid-range hypersonic missile. Steve Rosenberg in Moscow has more details. The Kremlin leader said Moscow mustn't and wouldn't get dragged into an expensive arms race. And Russia, he said, would not deploy short-and medium-range weapons in Europe or any other region unless US weapons were deployed there first. He instructed his ministers not to initiate further disarmament talks with Washington, although he made it clear that Russia's proposals on this issue remained on the table. The United States and NATO have accused Moscow of violating the terms of the INF Treaty. Russia has made similar allegations against the United States.\nVenezuela's self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido is attempting to mobilize tens of thousands of his supporters for a day of demonstrations. It's intended to increase pressure on Nicolas Maduro to relinquish the presidency. Orla Guerin in Caracas. However large the protest maybe, the sense here is that it will take a lot more than that to unseat Mr. Maduro. But the opposition believed that a process of change has begun. So far, it seems the president still has the backing of the military leadership, but he is under growing pressure, especially since the US imposed sanctions on the state-owned oil firm this week. That will starve him of revenue and could quickly paralyze the country, which is already stricken by shortages and hyperinflation.\nThousands of yellow vest protesters are congregating in Paris and elsewhere in France in the latest round of demonstrations against the cost of living and the policies of President Emmanuel Macron. This week they are also focusing their anger on the police's use of crowd control guns built as nonlethal that shoot large rubber balls. The projectiles known as flash balls have injured many protesters, resulting in some losing an eye. And that's the latest BBC News.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是大卫·奥斯汀，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n美国决定退出一份冷战期间签订的核武器条约，普京回应称俄罗斯也会采取相同的措施。我们的回应将会与之相同。美方宣布退出协议，我们也会退出。他们宣布正在进行调查与研发工作，我们也会开始相同的工作。普京在与外交部长和国防部长的会议中表示，俄罗斯将会开始研发新的中程超音速导弹，以下是史蒂夫·罗森博格在莫斯科的详细报道。普京表示莫斯科不允许也不会再被带进一场军备竞赛之中。他还表示俄罗斯将不会在欧洲和其他地区部署短程和中程导弹，除非美国率先开始部署。他要求各部长不要与美国进行更进一步的裁军谈判，但他也明确表示俄罗斯关于该问题的提议仍可以进行协商。美国和北约指责莫斯科当局违反了《中导条约》，俄罗斯也向美国提出了相同的指控。\n自称为委内瑞拉临时总统胡安·瓜伊多正企图动员几万名支持者进行一天的抗议活动。此举意在向尼古拉斯·马杜洛施压，让他放弃总统职位。以下是欧蕾·盖林在加拉加斯的报道。不管这场抗议活动会有多大，人们认为这些还不足打败马杜罗。但是反对党认为变革的进程已经开始了。到现在为止，总统仍有军队领导人的支持，但是自从美国本周宣布对委内瑞拉国营石油公司进行制裁之后，马杜罗的压力也越来越大。此举将会断绝马杜罗的财政收入来源并迅速使国家瘫痪，委内瑞拉现已处于着资金短缺和恶性通货膨胀的困境。\n在最后一轮游行活动中，数千名黄马甲组织人员集合在巴黎和法国其他地区，抗议生活成本增加和总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的政策。本周他们将怒火集中在警方对抗议人群使用“人群控制枪”的问题上，这种枪的设计不会致命，只是发射大型的橡胶弹。这种枪弹被称为闪光球，已经使很多抗议人员受伤，导致一些人失去了一只眼睛。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>**A Father and A Son**\n**父子俩**\nPassing through the Atlanta airport one morning, I caught one of those trains that take travelers from the main terminal to their boarding gates. Free, sterile and impersonal, the trains run back and forth all day long. Not many people consider them fun, but on this Saturday I heard laughter.\n一天早晨去亚特兰大机场，我看见一辆列车载载着旅客从航空集散站抵达登记处。这类免费列车每天单调、无味地往返其间，没人觉得有趣。但这个周六我却听到了笑声。\nAt the front of the first car – looking out the window at the track that lay ahead – were a man and his son.\n在头节车厢的最前面，坐着一个男人和他的儿子。他们正透过窗户观赏着一直往前延伸的铁道。\nThey had just stopped to let off passengers, and the doors wee closing again. “Here we go! Hold on to me tight!” the father said. The boy, about five years old, made sounds of sheer delight.\n他们停下来等候旅客下车，之后，车门关上了。“走吧。拉紧我！”父亲说。儿子大约5岁吧，一路喜不自禁。\nI know we’re supposed to avoid making racial distinctions these days, so I hope no one will mind if I mention that most people on the train were white, dressed for business trips or vacations – and that the father and son were black, dressed in clothes that were just about as inexpensive as you can buy.\n车上坐的多半是衣冠楚楚，或公差或度假的白人，只有这对黑人父子穿着朴素简单。我知道如今我们不该种族歧视，我希望我这样描述没人介意。\n“Look out there!” the father said to his son. “See that pilot? I bet he’s walking to his plane.” The son craned his neck to look.\n“快看！”父亲对儿子说：“看见那位飞行员了吗？我敢肯定是去开飞机的。”儿子伸长脖子看。\nAs I got off, I remembered some thing I’d wanted to buy in the terminal. I was early for my flight, so I decided to go back.\n下了车后我突然想起还得在航空集散站买点东西。离起飞时间还早，于是我决定再乘车回去。\nI did – and just as I was about to reboard the train for my gate, I saw that the man and his son had returned too. I realized then that they hadn’t been heading for a flight, but had just been riding the shuttle.\n正准备上车的时候，我看到那对父子也来了。我意识到他们不是来乘飞机的，而是特意来坐区间列车的。\n"You want to go home now? " The father asked.\n爸爸问：“你想现在回家吗？”\n“I want to ride some more!”\n“我还想再坐一会儿！”\n“More?” the father said, mock-exasperated but clearly pleased. “You’re not tired?”\n“再坐一会儿！”父亲嗔怪模仿着儿子的语调，“你还不累？”\n“This is fun!” his son said.\n“真好玩！”儿子说。\n“All right,” the father replied, and when a door opened we all got on.\n“好吧，”父亲说。车门开了，我们都上了车。\nThere are parents who can afford to send their children to Europe or Disneyland, and the children turn out rotten. There are parents who live in million-dollar houses and give their children cars and swimming pools, yet something goes wrong.\n我们很多父母有能力送孩子去欧洲，去狄斯尼乐园，可孩子还是堕落了。很多父母住豪华别墅，孩子有车有游泳池，可孩子还是学坏了。\n“Where are all these people going, Daddy?” the son asked.\n“爸爸，这些人去哪？”儿子问。\n“All over the world,” came the reply. The other people in the air port wee leaving for distant destinations or arriving at the ends of their journeys. The father and son, though, were just riding this shuttle together, making it exciting, sharing each other’s company.\n“世界各地。”父亲回答。机场来来往往的人流或准备远行，或刚刚归来。这对父子却在乘坐区间列车，享受着父子间的亲情与陪伴。\nHere was a father who cared about spending the day with his son and who had come up with this plan on a Saturday morning.\n而这里。这位父亲却很在意花上一天陪伴儿子，并在这样一个星期六的早上，提出这个计划。\nParents who care enough to spend time, and to pay attention and to try their best. It doesn’t cost a cent, yet it is the most valuable thing in the world.\n父母愿意花时间，愿意关注，愿意尽心尽职。这不要花一分钱，可这却是世间无价之宝。\nThe train picked up speed, and the father pointed something out, and the boy laughed again.\n火车加速了。父亲指着窗外说着什么，儿子直乐.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Debbie Russ with the BBC news. Police in Paris say they believe a fire that engulfed a residential building during the night killing eight people was started deliberately. The Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said a woman who lived in the building had been detained. At this stage, the information we have points to criminal activity as the main line of investigation. One person has been arrested, a person who lives in the building. This person was arrested during the night, not far from the scene, not far from the fire, and she's currently in custody. Residents say the woman had psychiatric problems and had been involved in a dispute with a neighbor, a fireman over loud music during which she threatened to set fire to the building. At least thirty other people have been injured in the blaze at the eight-storey building in the west of the French capital.\nThe former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and a delegation of influential opposition figures are meeting the Taliban in Moscow for political talks. Last month, hopes were raised when the Taliban and US officials apparently drafted the framework for an initial peace deal. But Afghan government officials are not taking part in the talks as the Taliban are refusing to meet them. Secunder Kermani reports. The insurgents have resisted American demands that they engage directly with President Ashraf Ghani's National Unity Government, which they dismissed as illegitimate. Those taking part in the talks say there is an opportunity to start a dialogue between the Taliban and important power brokers in Afghanistan, but some in Kabul see them as an attempt by political rivals to undermine the Afghan government, an exploring deal with the Taliban behind their backs.\nState media in Ethiopia are reporting that more than two hundred people have been arrested in the west of the country where they were receiving illegal military training. It says they were stopped by the army and police close to the Sudanese border, where ethnic clashes have displaced tens of thousands of people. The security forces in Burkina Faso say they've killed a large number of militants in response to an attack in which fourteen civilians were killed in the north of the country. The military said armed men attacked the village of Kain in Yatenga province on Sunday night. A military statement said the Burkinabe army conducted a large scale operation in three northern provinces, reportedly killing 146 militants.\nUS government scientists have published an unscheduled update to their model of the Earth's magnetic field to deal with the speeding-up of the magnetic North Pole. Magnetic north, which is the place that compasses point to, is constantly moving. But the latest changes have been greater than expected. And that's the latest world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是黛比·罗斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。昨晚巴黎一座居民楼发生大火，导致8人死亡，警方认为是有人蓄意纵火。巴黎检察官雷米·赫兹表示该楼里的一名女性现已被拘捕。随着调查的进行，目前阶段的信息显示这是一起犯罪行为。该楼的一名住户现已被逮捕。该嫌疑人在当晚离火灾事发地不远处被捕，现在在监禁中。住户们表示这名女性精神有问题，她曾与邻居消防员因音乐声音过大发生争吵，当时她扬言要烧了这座楼。在这栋位于法国首都以西的8层建筑中，至少有三十人在大火中受伤。\n前阿富汗总统哈米德·卡尔扎伊和有影响力的反对党代表正在莫斯科与塔利班举行政治谈判。上个月，当塔利班与美国官员起草首个和平协议的框架时，希望重新燃起。但是阿富汗政府官员并没有参与到谈判中来，因为塔利班拒绝见他们。以下是赛康德·科芒尼的报道。塔利班拒绝了美国让他们与阿什拉夫·加尼的国家统一政府直接接触的要求，他们称这个政府是不合法的。与会者表示这是塔利班和阿富汗政治掮客开启对话的机会。首都喀布尔的一些人认为这是政治对手来削弱阿富汗政府的一种手段，是他们背后与塔利班进行的探索性交易。\n埃塞俄比亚的国家媒体报道称，在西部地区有200多人被逮捕，原因是他们正在接受非法的军事训练。据报道，埃塞俄比亚军队和警察在苏丹边境终止了他们的训练，当地的民族冲突也导致数万人从家乡逃离。布基纳法索的安全部队表示他们杀死了大量的武装分子，以报复他们在国家北部杀死十四名平民的袭击。军方表示武装分子周日晚袭击了亚滕加省该隐村。一名军方发言人表示布基纳法索军队在三个北方省份实施了大规模的行动，报道称杀死了146名武装分子。\n美国科学家意外地发表了一份他们的地球磁场模型的更新，该模型旨在记录地球磁场北极的加速移动。地磁北极，也就是指南针所指的方向，它正在不断地移动，最近的变化比预期的更快。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Eileen Mckue with the BBC News.\nUS-backed forces are continuing an all-out offensive to defeat hundreds of Islamic State fighters from their last hold out in northeastern Syria. IS militants are reported to be putting up fierce resistance. Sebastian Usher reports.\nAir strikes by the US-led coalition and artillery fire have pummeled the IS position which measures about four square kilometres. The SDF, a Kurdish-led alliance believes it will shortly achieve a decisive victory. There may still be up to six hundred IS fighters in the area. Thousands of civilians have escaped but others are believed to remain. IS does still hold another scrap of territory in Syria and it continues to carry out dozens of attacks. Even if it loses every last fragment of its once-vaunted and self-declared caliphate, the group still poses a potent threat in both Syria and Iraq.\nTrade and conflict will dominate discussions at the African Union Summit, which is getting underway in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Particular emphasis is being placed on the more than twenty million people who have been forced to flee their homes because of wars. Emmanuel Igunza reports from the meeting.\nThe UN Refugee Agency says Africa holds more than a quarter of the world's refugees and internal displace, a total of more than twenty million people. The leaders will also discuss efforts to integrate the continent's trade policies, following the signing last year of an European Union style free market agreement. The African Union has embarked on a series of reforms to streamline its operations and make it less dependent on international financial support. It hopes the changes can also help the AU shed its image of a body that has plans and ambitions but achieves little.\nIndia says more than 1700 people have died in various incidents of human-elephant conflict in the past three years. In the same period, the Ministry of Environment says 373 elephants lost their lives due to electrocution and poaching. This report from Anbrathan Antirajon.\nWildlife expert say deforestation and expanding human settlements along space of forest used by elephants known as elephant corridors as the reasons for the high number of deaths of both humans and the animals. Farmers trying to chase away marauding elephants using firecrackers, drums and fire bombs have become a regular occurrence, particularly in states like Assam, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Desperate farmers often put up illegal electric fences to stop the animals from destroying the crops leading to elephant deaths. India is home to the largest population of Asian elephants in the world and estimated twenty-seven thousand animals.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是艾琳·麦克尤，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n美国支持的军事力量将对叙利亚北部数百名伊斯兰国战士所坚守的最后领域发起全面进攻。据报道，伊斯兰国激进分子将进行激烈的抵抗。以下是塞巴斯蒂安·厄什尔的报道。\n美国领导的联盟已对伊斯兰国组织约四平方公里的驻地进行了空袭和炮击。库尔德领导的联盟，叙利亚民主力量（SDF）认为他们很快便将取得决定性的胜利。该区域内可能还有多达600名伊斯兰国战士。数千名平民已经逃离该区，但据信仍有人留在那里。伊斯兰国组织在叙利亚还有一块驻地，他们还继续了发起了数十次袭击。即使失去了最后一片自称的伊斯兰领土，该组织仍是叙利亚和伊拉克境内一个潜在的威胁。\n贸易和冲突仍将是非洲联盟峰会的主要议题，峰会正在埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴进行。峰会将特别关注两千多万因战事而被迫逃离家乡的难民。以下是埃马纽埃尔·伊谷文泽的报道。\n联合国难民署表示非洲有世界四分之一的难民以及国内的无家可归者，总数超过了两千万。领导人们还将讨论整合非洲大陆贸易政策的措施，他们在去年也签署了一份欧盟式自由市场协议。非盟现已开启了一系列改革措施来提高工作效率，并减少其对国际金融援助的依赖。他们希望这些改革能够帮助非盟摆脱“有计划有抱负，但是很少能实现”的形象。\n印度表示在过去的三年里有1700多人死于各种人象冲突。印度环境部表示，同期有373头大象死于触电和偷猎。以下是安德布里森·安迪罗杰的报道。\n野生动物专家表示，森林砍伐和人类居住地扩张侵占了有“大象走廊”之称的森林这是导致人类和动物大量死亡的原因。农民用鞭炮、锣鼓和燃烧弹驱赶破坏庄稼的大象已成为常态，特别是在阿萨姆邦，西孟加拉邦和泰米尔纳德邦等州。绝望的农民通常是架起非法电围栏来防止大象破坏他们的庄稼，这也导致了大象死亡。印度是世界上拥有亚洲象最多的国家，据估计有27,000头。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Nick Kelly with the BBC News. Democrats and Republicans in the United States say they've reached an agreement in principle on border security that they hope will avoid a second government shutdown. They hope to turn the agreement into legislation by Wednesday, two days before the current federal funding agreement runs out. Gary O'Donoghue reports. The tentative deal reached between Republicans and Democrats still has to be finalized, but sources close to the negotiations suggest the President may only get around a quarter of the 5.7 billion dollars he was looking for to build more border wall. The big uncertainty is what the President will be prepared to sign. At a rally in el Paso in texas last night, he was giving little away about his attitude to the emerging deal. What there was at the rally was plenty of heated rhetoric about illegal immigrants and crime, and of course, fake news with my BBC cameraman Ron Skins attacked by a Trump supporter as he went about his job filming the speech.\nThe former Vice President of the Spanish region of Catalonia, Oriol Junqueras and eleven other separatists are going on trial later in Madrid over the 2017 Catalan referendum and subsequent declaration of independence. Guy Hedgecoe is in Madrid. This is Spain's most politically sensitive trial for decades. Among the defendants is Oriol Junqueras, former Vice President of Catalonia, who could face up to twenty-five years in prison if found guilty of rebellion. He and several other defendants have been held in custody for months ahead of the trial, prompting claims by their defense teams that this whole judicial process lacks credibility. But the government says the trial, which is expected to last around three months, has all the necessary guarantees.\nPoliticians have been accused of failing to comprehend the dangers posed by multiplying environmental crises. The warning comes from the Institute for Public Policy Research in Britain. Here's Roger Harrabin. The report warns of a potentially deadly combination of factors affecting the planet, including climate change and the mass loss of species, especially insects. The authors note widespread erosion of topsoil, forest felling, acidifying oceans, extrem weather, plastic in the seas, overfishing and more. The report says these factors are driving what they call a complex dynamic process of environmental destabilization. They say this destabilization is occurring at speeds unprecedented in human history. This is the world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼克·凯利，欢迎收听BBC新闻。美国民主党和共和党表示他们已经就边境安全问题达成了一项原则性协议，并希望可以避免下一次政府停摆。他们希望周三前对此进行立法，而两天后现有的联邦资金就将用尽，以下是盖里·奥多诺霍的报道。民主党和共和党之间达成的尝试性协议还有待落实，但是接近该协商的消息人士称特朗普可能只会得到他要求的57亿边境墙资金的四分之一。特朗普将会如何签署这份协议成为了一个很大的不确定因素。在昨晚的埃尔帕索集会中，特朗普并没有透露太多对新协议的看法。集会上充满了关于非法移民、犯罪和假新闻的激进言论，BBC摄影师罗恩·斯金斯在拍摄集会讲话时就遭到了一名特朗普支持者的袭击。\n前西班牙加泰罗尼亚副总统奥利奥尔·容克拉斯以及其余11名分裂主义分子将会在晚些时候在马德里就2017年的加泰罗尼亚公投和以及后续的宣布独立事件接受审判。以下是盖伊·海吉科的报道。这是西班牙几十年来最具政治敏感性的审判。被告奥利奥尔·容克拉斯是加泰罗尼亚前总统，如果反叛罪名成立，他将面临最高25年的监禁。在审判之前，他和几名其他被告已被关押数月之久，他们的辩护团队称整个司法过程缺乏可信度。但是政府表示该审判将会持续约三个月，并且有所有必要的保障。\n研究指出政府人员没能正确理解多重环境危机带来的危害。该警告出自英国公共政策研究院，以下是罗杰·哈里宾的报道。该报告对影响地球的潜在危险因素的合集做出了警告，其中就包括气候变化以及特别是昆虫在内的大量物种灭绝。报告指出的问题包括表层土壤的侵蚀、森林砍伐、海洋酸化、极端天气、海洋的塑料污染、过度捕鱼以及更多问题。他们的报告称这些因素导致了环境不稳定的复杂动态过程。他们表示环境不稳定过程正在以人类历史上最快的速度发展。BBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>The BBC News with Fiona MacDonald.\nThe European aerospace firm Airbus has announced that it will stop making the world's biggest airplane the A380 superjumbo. The double-decker aircraft was designed to challenge the 747 of Airbus's rival Boeing. Rob Young reports.\nThe era of the Superjumbo is drawing to an end, just thirteen years after the A380 flew for the first time, Airbus says it will stop production with the final plane to be delivered in two years' time. The A380 is regarded as a great technological achievement. It's estimated to have cost about fifteen billion pounds to develop. But Airbus has struggled to sell the giant planes with airlines increasingly turning to smaller, more fuel efficient aircraft for long haul flights. The final nail in the coffin was a decision by Emirates, the Gulf Airline that's been the planes biggest fan to cut substantially its outstanding order.\nThe journalist at the head of an award-winning news website in the Philippines which criticized the country's President has been bailed after spending the night in detention. Maria Ressa, the head of Rappler website was arrested on Wednesday over a libel charge relating to an article published seven years ago. Here's Howard Johnson.\nLots of people have come forward to condemn this move. We've heard from the Vice President of the country Leni Robredo, she said that this is pure political harassment a view that's been echoed by many people in the media here who say that this is a clampdown on freedom of speech. Let's not forget Rapper had urged Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in the past for their coverage of his drug war.

A report by the official Saudi Press Agency said the Gulf kingdom had taken a number of measures to combat financial irregularities.\nFemale students at a prestigious Indian college have called for the scrapping of a decades-old Valentine's day tradition in which their male colleagues worship a so-called Virgin Tree. Women at the Hindu college in Delhi say the practice of adorning the tree with ribbons, condoms filled with water and posters representing the curvaceous goddess Damdami Mai is patriarchal and misogynistic. The male students say the ritual is a bit of harmless fun.\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n欢迎收听BBC新闻，我是菲奥娜·麦克唐纳德。\n欧洲飞机制造公司空客宣布他们将停止生产世界最大客机“空中巨无霸”A380。这款双层飞机是空客为了挑战对手波音的747而设计的。以下是罗勃·杨的报道。\n在A380 首次起飞仅13年后，“空中巨无霸”的时代就已经落幕了。空客表示最后一架A380将会在两年内交付，之后将会停产。A380被誉为是一项巨大的科技成就。据估计其研发成本超过了150亿英镑。但是空客在这款巨无霸客机的销售上遇到了问题，因为越来越多的航空公司更倾向于在长途航线上采用体型更小更省油的飞机。导致停产的致命一击还在于阿联酋的海湾航空公司，该公司一直以来都是A380最忠实的粉丝，但现在却大规模削减订单了。\n菲律宾一家新闻网站的著名新闻工作者在经过一夜的拘留后被保释，她曾批评过该国总统。玛丽亚·雷萨是Rappler新闻网的首席执行官，周三她因7年前涉嫌撰文诽谤总统被捕。以下是霍华德·约翰逊的报道。\n很多人站出来谴责该做法。我们从该国副总统莱妮·罗布雷多处得到消息，她表示这是纯粹的政治迫害，这一观点也得到了很多媒体人士的响应，他们称这是对言论自由的镇压。需要记住的是，Rapper新闻网曾在毒品战争的报道中告诫过总统罗德里戈·杜特尔特。现在总统发言人站出来称此事无关言论自由。他表示这纯粹是一起诽谤案，是一名商人起诉这家媒体的私人诽谤案。\n欧盟委员会提议将沙特阿拉伯列入一份名单之中，该名单包括在反洗钱方面力度不足以及资助恐怖主义的国家。对此，沙特表示遗憾。沙特官方新闻社报道称，海湾王国已经采取了大量的措施打击金融不法行为。\n印度一所著名大学的女学生呼吁废除一项数十年之久的情人节习俗，在这一天，男同学将会祭拜一棵所谓的处女树。这所位于德里的印度大学的女性表示，为这棵树装扮上彩带、灌满水的避孕套以及代表‘爱之神’的海报的行为是男权和歧视女性的表现。该校男学生表示该习俗并无恶意。\nBBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC News. The two main political parties in Nigeria have condemned the country's electoral commission for postponing the presidential and parliamentary elections hours before polling was due to start. The head of the commission is Mahmoud Yakubu. This will afford the commission the opportunity to address identified challenges in order to maintain the quality of our elections. This was a difficult decision for the commission to take, but necessary for the successful delivery of elections and the consolidation of our democracy. Mr. Yakubu said legistical problems had made it impossible to hold the vote on schedule, but both the governing All Progressives Congress and the opposition People's Democratic Party criticized the commission for not being prepared and then accused each other of trying to manipulate the vote. Both have urged calm.\nThe Roman Catholic Church has defrocked the former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick over allegations of child abuse. The Vatican said Pope Francis had ruled his expulsion from the clergy as definitive and would not allow any further appeals against the decision. Theodore McCarrick was the former Archbishop of Washington D.C. Martin Bashir reports. Theodore McCarrick was informed of the church's decision to remove him from the priesthood last night. And a terse statement from the Vatican this morning said that he'd been found guilty of sins against minors and adults with the aggravating factor of the abuse of power. Last July, he resigned as a cardinal, the first to do so in more than a hundred years, after credible allegations emerged that he'd sexually assaulted a sixteen-year-old altar boy and then molested another fourteen-year-old.\nIndia's fastest train has broken down a day after it was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi with much fanfare. Anbrathan Antirajon has the story. The state-of-the-art Vande Bharat Express was returning from the Indian city of Varanasi after its first outing when the brakes reportedly jammed in one of the carriages. Soon after that drivers noticed a smoke in the last four coaches, and power was lost in all compartments. Those on board, mostly railway officials and journalists, had to take another train to get back to Delhi. Some reports said the express had hit a stray cow. The train is expected to reduce the travel time between Delhi and Varanasi by six hours. The new train service is expected to start its commercial run from Sunday. And that's the latest BBC News.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是大卫·奥斯汀，欢迎收听BBC新闻。尼日利亚选举委员会在投票开始几小时前推迟了总统和议会大选，该国两大政党对此表示谴责。以下是马哈茂德·雅库布的讲话。该决定将会让委员会有更多时间处理已发现的问题，从而保证选举的质量。这对于委员会来说也是一个艰难的决定，但是对选举的成功交接和民主的稳定来说是必须的。雅库布表示出于法律问题要推迟原定的投票时间，但是执政的“进步国会”党和反对党人民民主党都批评了选举委员会准备不足，然后互相谴责对方企图操纵选举。双方都敦促冷静。\n罗马天主教教会就虐待儿童的指控免去了前主教西奥多·麦卡里克的职务。梵蒂冈方面表示，教宗方济各已经开除了他的神职，并且不允许对该决定提起上诉。西奥多·麦卡里克曾是前华盛顿特区的大主教。以下是马丁·巴希尔的报道。昨晚，西奥多·麦卡里克收到教会通知开除了他的神职。今天早晨梵蒂冈的一份简短声明表示，已认定他严重滥用权力，对未成年人和成年人犯下罪行。去年七月，他辞去了主教职务，这也是一百多年来的首次，原因是证据确凿的指控称他性侵了一名16岁辅祭男孩，并且猥亵了另一名14岁的男孩。\n由总理纳伦德拉·莫迪隆重宣布的印度最快火车在一天后出现故障。以下是安德布里森·安迪罗杰的报道。先进的的范德·巴拉特快车当时正从印度城市瓦拉纳西返回，据报道，首次发车之后一节车厢的制动器卡住了。司机发现最后四节车厢冒烟不久后，所有的车厢失去动力。车上大部分都是铁道官员和记者，他们不得不坐另一辆火车返回德里。有报道称火车撞上了一头离群的牛。据悉，该火车预计可以将德里和瓦拉纳西的行程减少6个小时。新的火车服务预计将在周日开启商用。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Eileen McKue. The Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido has outlined his plan to fracture support for President Nicolas Maduro by organizing a huge humanitarian aid distribution operation across Venezuela. Mr. Guaido said he had recruited over six hundred thousand volunteers who would carry the aid from border crossings next Saturday. Food and medicine has been arriving in US military transport planes at the Colombian border town of Cucuta. A representative of Mr. Guaido's interim government Lester Toledo spoke supplies were being unloaded. The most important thing is that the day is close when the doors at the Colombia-Venezuela border will open, so that only meters from here, not only humanitarian aid will go through, not only medical supplies, not only food for our people who don't have any will go through, but also freedom.\nThe acting US Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has said he is not yet determined whether a border wall with Mexico is a military necessity or how much Pentagon money would be used for building it. He said he would start reviewing the initial military planning on Sunday. Mr. Shanahan said the Pentagon had identified the steps needed to take a final call on the subject, but deliberately not made any decisions yet.\nKenya has recalled its ambassador from Mogadishu and reportedly ordered the Somali envoy in Nairobi to return to his country. The neighboring states are engaged in a maritime boundary dispute over an area that's thought to contain lucrative gas and oil reserves. The Kenyan government said the summons was a result of a decision by Somalia to auction off oil and gas blocks in Kenya's maritime territorial area that borders Somalia. The International Court of Justice is hearing a case in the dispute.\nUS Vice President Mike Pence has urged European Leaders to follow Washington's lead and withdraw from what he called the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. In a speech to the Munich Security Council, Mr. Pence said America First did not mean America alone. The time has come for our European partners to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and join us as we bring the economic and diplomatic pressure necessary to give the Iranian people, the region and the world the peace, security, and freedom they deserve.\nVandles in London have painted graffiti on the grave of the German revolutionary philosopher Karl Marx. The second attack on his memorial this month. Slogans like "architect of genocide" were dogged in red paint on the four-metre-high monument. Police say they've made no arrests over the hammer attack earlier this month.

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC News.\nThe Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the country's three main political parties have been hit by sophisticated cyber attack on their computer networks. He said Australia security agencies believed an unnamed foreign government was behind the attacks.\nMembers will be aware that the Australian Cyber Security Center recently identified a malicious intrusion into the Australian Parliament House computer network. During the course of this work, we also became aware that the networks of some political parties - Liberal, Labor and Nationals have also been affected.\nMr. Morrison did not reveal what information had been accessed, but he said there was no evidence of electoral interference.\nAt least four Indian soldiers and two suspected separatist rebels have been killed in a gunfight in disputed Kashmir. The clash happened in Pulwama district where there had been a suicide attack last week. Sangita Myska reports.\nIt was in the early hours of this morning that soldiers and security police sealed off a village in the district of Pulwama. Security forces say they fired warning shots into the air when militants immediately fired back. Villages in the area have been the focus of intense searches throughout the weekend as Indian forces attempt to isolate members of the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad who claimed responsibility for last week's suicide bombing. Since then India has attempted to have Pakistan isolated diplomatically by appealing to its international allies to cut all ties.\nTrade talks between Britain and Japan are reported to have soured after Japanese officials received a letter from their British counterparts urging them to speed up negotiations. The Financial Times newspaper says the officials were dismayed at the wording, which said that Britain was committed to speed and flexibility and hoped for Japan was, too. They are said to have interpreted this as an accusation that Tokyo was dragging its feet.\nA British parliamentary committee has called for a compulsory code of ethics to regulate Facebook and other big social media companies to help limit fake news and other harmful content.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Debbie Russ with the BBC News. Nigerians will soon begin casting their ballots in presidential and parliamentary elections that were postponed, excuse me last Saturday with only a few hours' notice. The main candidates are President Muhammadu Buhari and a former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. Purgle King reports. This is the biggest election in African history with eighty-four million registered voters spread across the continent's most populous nation. Logistical difficulties that cause the postponement of the polls now seem to have been overcome with the National Election Commission assuring voters across the country they would be able to vote. There are still problems not least in the northeast where nearly two million people are displaced and the Boko Haram group and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa have threatened to attack voters. President Muhammadu Buhari has said the police will deal firmly with anybody trying to disrupt the poll.\nThe Venezuelan has shut part of the border with Colombia, complaining of serious threats against its sovereignty. The closure was announced as President Nicolas Maduro's opponents made final preparations to move aid, much of it from the United States across the frontier. From Caracas, here's Katy Watson. This is the day Venezuela's opposition has been waiting for, a day that will test the loyalty of the country's armed forces towards Nicolas Maduro and determine his future. Lorries laden with aid are expected to set off from both Columbia and Brazil and attempt to cross the border. Throughout Vnezuela, people will gather military barracks to ask soldiers for their help in the aid effort. Until now, senior officers have remained loyal to Mr. Maduro, but with pressure being heaped on them to help the Venezuelan people, will they listen to their leader or change sides support Juan Guaido and open the borders?\nThe British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing open divisions within her cabinet over Brexit with a deadline for withdrawal from the EU just over a month away. Three senior ministers have defied government policy to warn that Brexit should be delayed if Parliament fails to approve a deal within days. Here is Nick Baldelli. It is no secret Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark have significant concerns about the prospect of there being no deal, but their latest intervention is significant. The government has yet to confirm whether a new deal will even be put to MPs next week, but this intervention adds to the pressure on the Prime Minister to get assurances from Brussels eminently. It is also a warning to Tory Brexiteers that if they do not back a tweaked version of the Prime Minister's deal, Brexit will be delayed and it will be their fault. That's the latest world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是黛比·罗斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻尼日利亚不久后将开始总统和国会选举，上周日，官方提前几个小时发布通知推迟了该选举。主要的候选人包括总统穆罕马杜·布哈里和前副总统阿提库·阿布巴卡。以下是普格尔·金的报道。这是非洲历史上最大的一次选举，在这个非洲人口最多的国家里，将会有8400万人注册为选民。导致选举推迟的后勤问题现在似乎已经解决，国家选举委员会向选民承诺他们将能够顺利投票。现在仍有一些问题需要处理，在东北地区有近200万人无家可归，博科圣地组织以及其分支伊斯兰国西非威胁称将会袭击选民。总统穆罕马杜·布哈里表示警方将会坚决打击任何想要破坏选举的人。\n委内瑞拉已经关闭了与哥伦比亚的部分边境，称对其主权造成了严重威胁。总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗宣布关闭边境，而反对党也已为转移救援物资做了最后的准备，这些物资大部分都是美国运到前线的。以下是凯蒂·华生在加拉加斯的报道。这一天是委内瑞拉反对党所期待的，这一天也将会检验委内瑞拉武装部队对尼古拉斯·马杜罗的忠诚度，并决定他的未来。装满救援物质的卡车预计将会从哥伦比亚和巴西出发，并尝试穿过边境。委内瑞拉全国上下的人民将会在集结在军事营地，请求士兵们帮助运送物资。直到现在，军方高级官员仍忠诚于马杜罗，但是外界让他们帮助委内瑞拉人民的压力也越来越大，他们会听从其领导人还是倒戈支持胡安·瓜伊多开放边境呢？\n英国首相特蕾莎·梅的内阁对还有一月就到最后期限的脱欧进程产生了分歧。政府的政策警告称如果国会不能在几天内通过一份方案，脱欧应该推迟。三名高级部长表示反对。以下是尼克·贝德利的报道。很明显，安伯·拉德，大卫·高克和格雷格·卡拉克非常担心没有脱欧协议，但是他们最近的干预取得了成效。政府还没有确认是否需要将新的协议在下周向议员提出，但是他们的干预也给首相从欧盟得到保证增加了很大的压力。这也是对托尼派脱欧人士的警告，如果他们不能接受修改版的首相脱欧协议，脱欧进程将会推迟，而且还会归咎到他们身上。以上就是最新的BBC国际新闻。

            The American space agency NASA and California SpaceX company preparing to launch astronaut capsule from US soil for the first time in eight years. The Dragon capsule will blast off on board a Falcon 9 rocket and will carry a dummy fitted with sensors to the International Space Station. NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier says using a private company won't compromise on standards.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Nick Kelly with the BBC News. A Judge in Brazil has agreed to release from prison the former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to attend the funeral of his seven-year-old grandson. The boy died of meningitis and will be buried on Saturday. Leonardo Rocha reports. Lula will fly from the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba in a jet that belongs to the local government. He will be leaving the federal police compound where he's serving his sentence for the first time since he was imprisoned in April. Lula rejects the corruption allegations and says he was imprisoned by his political opponents to prevent him from running for office again last year. For many, he led the most corrupt government in Brazilian history, but the country is split politically and thousands are expected to turn up at the cemetery to show the support for the former president.\nThe United States has cancelled the visas of forty-nine Venezuelan officials who helped close the country's borders last Saturday to block the delivery of foreign aid. The US State Department said the officials were responsible for undermining Venezuela's democracy. The sanctions were also applied to their family members. President Nicolas Maduro rejected the offer of humanitarian aid donated mainly by the US, saying it was a pretext for a ground invasion.\nThe American space agency NASA and California SpaceX company preparing to launch astronaut capsule from US soil for the first time in eight years. The Dragon capsule will blast off on board a Falcon 9 rocket and will carry a dummy fitted with sensors to the International Space Station. NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier says using a private company won't compromise on standards. We're doing things that are really risky and the designs and the complexity of what we have to do. We're strapping human beings on top of rockets with millions of pounds of thrust, hurling them into orbit to go attached to a space station to do world-cutting research. That isn't trivial.\nThe US ambassador to London has described the European Union as a museum of agriculture with a traditionalist and unsustainable approach to farming. In an article for a British newspaper, Woody Johnson writes that criticism in Britain of American farming is part of a smear campaign by those who want to prevent a trade deal between the US and the UK after Britain leaves the EU. Earlier this week, the US set out its objectives for such a trade deal, which would force the UK to abandon European food standards.\nThe court of appeal in Quebec has upheld a ruling in a lawsuit ordering three big tobacco companies to pay more than eleven billion dollars in damages to smokers and ex-smokers in the Canadian province. The plaintiffs alleged that the companies had known since the 1950s the tobacco cause cancer and had failed to warn consumers.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼克·凯利，欢迎收听BBC新闻。巴西的一名法官同意释放前总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦，让其参加7岁孙子的葬礼。这名男孩死于脑膜炎，将于周六埋葬。以下是莱昂纳多·罗查的报道。卢拉乘当地政府的飞机从巴西南部城市库里蒂巴出发。他将离开巴西联邦警察局，去年四月份他被判入狱后现正在此服刑。卢拉否认了腐败的指控，并表示他是被政治对手关进监狱的，目的是防止他在去年再次竞选总统。对很多人来说，他曾领导了巴西历史上最为腐败的政府，但是巴西现正在政治分裂，预计数千人将会现身葬礼，以表示对前总统的支持。\n美国取消了49名委内瑞拉官员的签证，因为他们在上周六帮助关闭该国边境，阻碍了国外救援物质的运输。美国国务院表示这些官员要对破坏委内瑞拉的民主负责。美国同样对他们的家人实施了制裁。总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗拒绝了主要由美国提供的人道主义援助，表示这是地面入侵的借口。\n加州的SpaceX公司和美国宇航局NASA准备发射8年来首个在美国国土上发射的载人飞船。“龙”飞船将会由猎鹰九号火箭发射升空，并将搭载装有感应器的人体模型飞往国际空间站。NASA的比尔·斯坦玛雅表示用私人公司不会降低标准。我们正在做的事情风险非常大，要做的设计难度和复杂程度也很高。我们正在将人置于火箭力，用数百万磅的推力将他们送往轨道和空间站对接，来做一些世界尖端的研究。这些都不是很容易就能做到的。\n美国驻伦敦大使将欧盟称为“农业博物馆”，称其在农业中仍使用传统和不可持续的方法。在英国报纸的一篇文章中，伍迪·约翰逊写道在英国对于美国农业的批评是一项诽谤活动，他们想要在英国脱欧后防止美国和英国达成贸易协议。本周早些时候，美国发出了贸易协议的标准，这将会强迫英国放弃欧洲的食品标准。\n魁北克的上诉法庭维持了烟草公司诉讼案的原判，判决三家大型烟草公司支付超过110亿美元给加拿大魁北克省的吸烟者和已经戒烟的人。原告称这些公司在上世纪50年代就知道烟草导致癌症，但是没有警告消费者。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Rosemary Crick with the BBC News. South Korea has confirmed that large-scale annual military exercises with the United States are to end. The war games which have always infuriated North Korea will be replaced with smaller-scale drills. Steve Jackson reports. For decades, the United States and South Korea have held joint military exercises, which have always triggered an irate response from the North. At one time, the biggest of these drills, known as Foal Eagle, involved almost a quarter of a million soldiers. Pyongyang accused its enemies of planning for an invasion. After President Trump's first summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un last year, some exercises were suspended. But now in spite of the failure of their second summit last week, the biggest of the military drills are to end. Future maneuvers will be on a small scale to avoid inflaming tensions with North Korea.\nA month after the deadly collapse of a dam in Brazil, the head of the mining company responsible has resigned. Fabio Schvartsmant had little choice after federal prosecutors recommended that he and several other senior executives of the mining giant Vale be removed. More than three hundred people died when the dam burst and a vast area was engulfed in toxic mud. Employees arrested as part of an official investigation said the company knew that the structure of the dam was compromised.\nThe Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido who is in Ecuador has called for new protests against the government of Nicolas Maduro on Monday and Tuesday. Mr. Guaido, the self-declared interim president of Venezuela said he would return home to take part although he faces the prospect of arrest. He defied a Supreme Court travel ban by crossing into Colombia a week ago to help coordinate foreign aid deliveries which Mr. Maduro rejected as part of a US-led plot to affect regime change.\nPolice in Mexico say gunmen have killed four people and injured ten others at a birthday party in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas. Witnesses described five or six people with rifles who arrived in a van and opened fire at the party in a function room.\nAustralia has criticized foreign companies involved in an oil spill that threatens the world's largest raised coral atoll in the Solomon Islands. It said there was a lack of action to limit the damage. From Sydney, Phil Mercer reports. At least seventy five tons of heavy fuel oil have spilled from the Solomon trader, a freighter registered in Hong Kong. It was driven into a reef in the Solomon Islands by a tropical cyclone in early February. Australia says the companies involved, including an Indonesian mining firm aren't doing enough to stop about six hundred tons of oil still on board the stricken ship from leaking. Rennell island is home to many species that are found nowhere else.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是罗斯玛丽·克里克，欢迎收听BBC新闻。韩国已经确定与美国的大型年度联合军演将会终结。军事演习一直以来都会激怒朝鲜，现在已经被替换成了小型的军演。以下是史蒂夫·杰克逊的报道。数十年以来，美国和朝鲜都会举行联合军演，而这一般都会引起朝鲜激烈的反应。美韩曾经举行过最大的一次军事演习，代号“鹞鹰”，大约有25万士兵参加。平壤当局曾指控他们的敌人正在计划入侵。自从特朗普和朝鲜最高领导人金正恩去年举行首次峰会之后，一些军事行动就被暂停了。尽管上周举行的第二次峰会以失败告终，但是最大的规模的军事演习还是取消了。未来的军事行动规模将会更小，以避免与朝鲜发生冲突。\n巴西水坝坍塌事故发生一个月之后，涉事的采矿公司的CEO现已辞职。法比欧·施瓦茨曼除了辞职之外别无选择，因为联邦检察员建议他和采矿巨头清水河谷的几名其他高管应该被免职。当大坝被冲开后，大面积区域被有毒的泥浆所吞噬，有超过300人遇难。在正式调查中被捕的公司雇员表示公司知道大坝的结构存在问题。\n委内瑞拉反对党领导人胡安·瓜伊多现正在厄瓜多尔，他呼吁在周一和周二举行新的抗议活动反对尼古拉斯·马杜罗的政府。瓜伊多自称为委内瑞拉的临时总统，他表示尽管有被捕的风险，他也将会回国参加这次抗议活动。他违反了最高法院的旅行禁令，一周前他穿越哥伦比亚边境协助运输国外救援物资，而马杜罗拒绝接受这些物资并称其为美国领导的企图推翻其政权的阴谋。\n墨西哥警方表示枪手在东北部的塔毛利帕斯州一个生日聚会上杀害了四人并导致了十多人受伤。目击者表示有五六个人乘坐面包车而来，手里拿着步枪，在客厅中向派对中的人开火。\n澳大利亚批评导致石油泄漏的涉事公司威胁到了所罗门群岛的上升珊瑚环礁。澳大利亚表示他们未采取措施来降低危害。以下是菲尔·默塞尔在悉尼的报道。至少有75吨的重燃油从一艘香港注册的所罗门商船上泄漏。2月初，该商船在在热带气旋带作用下在所罗门群岛触礁。澳大利亚表示涉事的公司包括一家印尼采矿公司，它没有采取足够的措施阻止船上约600吨的原油继续泄漏。伦内尔岛上有很多世界上独有的物种。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Eileen McKue with the BBC News.\nAt least twenty-three people have been killed in Alabama after tornadoes hit the US state. Jay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County on the border with Georgia, said the number could rise as the authority searched through the rubble and debris. The victims include a number of children. Alabama governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency. Chip Brownlee is a local journalist in Auburn, in Lee County.\nIt came up just so fast. You know, I think, you know, people don't have time to get out of the way of these things, especially when they're moving as fast as they were moving today. And when this one was particularly as powerful as it was, there's not much you can do, particularly when these things are leveling homes like this one did, snap trees in half. It's flipping cars.President Trump has urged people in the region to stay safe.\nVenezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido says he's returning to his country after a week-long tour of South America to amass support for his attempt to remove President Nicolas Maduro from power. Speaking on social media from an undisclosed location, Mr. Guaido said he would lead anti-government marches throughout Venezuela on Monday and Tuesday. This report from Will Grant.\nWe'll see each other tomorrow, Juan Guaido told his supporters in a late night address on Sunday via Facebook live. It was a reference to a march he's called for in Caracas, although it isn't yet clear if he will actually be back in the country by then or how he intends to return. He was placed under a travel ban by the Supreme Court loyal to President Maduro. Now his intention is to come back to Venezuela, which may provoke the Maduro government into arresting him. If they do, he said it would be one of their last mistakes in office.\nThe United States will on Monday merge the activities of its consulate in Israel with those of its embassy in a move that's angered Palestinians. The consulate in Jerusalem has until now operated as a semi-independent diplomatic mission serving Palestinians in the disputed city and acting as a direct channel of communication between Washington and the Palestinian authority. The merger will make the consulate subordinate to the US ambassador to Israel David Freeman, considered a supporter of the Israeli settlement program in the West Bank.\nPolice in Kenya say a helicopter has crashed in the northwest of the country, killing all four American passengers on board and their pilot. Reports say the helicopter came down after taking off from a tourist camp on a remote island in Lake Turkana on Sunday evening. The cause is not yet known.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Eileen McKue with the BBC News. India has played down the impact of an end to its preferential trade status with the United States after President Trump announced that he intended to scrap the program. The Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said the move would have a minimal economic impact and that Delhi was keeping retaliatory tariffs out of its talks with the US. Devina Gupta is in Delhi. This means that from here on now these goods will have to be under a duty and big exporters will have to shell out more money and in India the Commerce Secretary pointed out although it's about export 5.6 billion dollars, but the economic impact of that will only be about a hundred and nine million dollars. So it's not so significant if we look in terms of trade. But yes, thousands of jobs are at risk here in India.\nA Japanese court has granted bail to the former automobile executive Carlos Ghosn who's been detained for more than three months on charges of financial misconduct. Merica Oria is in Singapore. The decision came as a surprise because in Japan bail is very granted unless you confess to the crimes you're accused of. And this is in fact his third request for bail. But he's recently changed his legal team and they've managed to succeed in getting him bail. It's not cheap though. A bail is set at one billion yen which is almost nine million US dollars, one of the highest in fact in Japan. Prosecutions are now appealing the decission. Remember he's facing allegations of financial misconduct. He's accused of underreporting his salary. He's also accused of transferring his investment losses onto Nisson all of which he denies. Merica Oria reporting from Singapore.\nWet winters are no longer a guide to the intensity of California wildfires. A study by international climate expert shows climate change is one of the factors ensuring that major fires can now happen in any year. Paul Rincon reports. Last year was California's most destructive wildfire season. Winter rains have been a guide to the intensity of fires in California for hundreds of years, but a new study shows that's no longer the case. More vegetation and dry conditions due to global warming now mean any year can have large fires. More effective efforts to tackle wildfires over the twentieth century mean this now more dry wood to burn regardless of a wet winter. As hot and dry conditions become more common globally, researchers say we can expect the number and intensity of wildfires to increase around the world. Paul Rincon reporting. BBC News.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是艾琳·麦克尤，欢迎收听BBC新闻。特朗普宣布他有意终结对印度的贸易优惠待遇，印度方面淡化了该措施对经济的影响。印度商务部长阿纳普·瓦达万表示这对经济的影响很小，印度在与美国的会谈中也会保持报复性关税。以下是戴维娜·古普塔在德里的报道。这意味着现在起这些货物将被征收关税，大型的出口商将会花更多的钱，印度商务部长也指出虽然出口的货物价值五十六亿美元，但是对经济的影响只有一亿零九百万美元。所以从贸易上来看影响不是太大。但是印度确实会有数千的工作岗位受到威胁。\n一家日本法院给与了前汽车大亨卡洛斯·戈恩保释，他因财务不当行为的指控被拘留了三个多月。以下是莫莉卡·奥里亚在新加坡的报道。该决定出乎意料，因为在日本不会轻易保释，除非你承认所指控的罪行。这实际上已经是他第三次请求保释了，他最近换了法律团队，他们成功地将他保释了出来。保释费并不便宜，达到了10亿日元，相当于900万美元，这也是日本最高的保释费之一。检方现在正对该决定上诉，他现在面临着财政不当行为、少报收入以及将个人投资损失转嫁给日产的指控，但是他全都否认了。以上是莫莉卡·奥里亚在新加坡的报道。\n潮湿的冬季不再是影响加州大火的因素。一份国际气候专家的研究显示气候变化成为了导致大火年年发生的因素。以下是保罗·里肯的报道。去年是加州最严重的山火季节。数百年来，冬季雨水成为了加州大火的影响因素，但是新研究显示事实已不再如此。由气候变暖导致的植被增多和干燥条件现在意味着每年都可能发生大火灾。20世纪以来救火的措施更加高效，这也意味着不管冬季是否多雨，干燥的木头越来越多。随着热干的环境在全球越来越多，研究者表示可以预测到全世界山火的数目和强度也会增加。以上是保罗·里肯的报道。BBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is the BBC News with Fiona MacDonald. For the second time this week, US analysts have reported activity at a military site in North Korea. It raises the possibility that the authorities may be preparing to launch a satellite or a missile. From Seoul, here's Laura Bicker. There has been increased activity around a missile and rocket assembly site known as Tongch'ang-dong near Pyongyang. Large vehicles have been seen moving around the facility, activity which in the past indicated that North Korea was at least preparing to move some kind of missile or rocket to a launch area. North Korea's main rocket launch site has also been rebuilt according to the images, and could be fully operational. Analysts believe that at this stage it's more likely that Pyongyang is preparing to launch a satellite rather than test a missile. But the US said earlier this week that this would still be inconsistent with the commitments Kim Jong-un made to Donald Trump.\nElectricity is gradually being restored in the Venezuelan capital Caracas and other parts of the country after the longest blackout there in decades. Will Grant reports from Caracas. Almost all twenty-three states in Venezuela plus the capital city plunged into darkness for more than a day. The chaos it caused was huge. The power cut came amid high political tension in the country with the opposition leader Juan Guaido trying to force President Nicolas Maduro from office. Both men tried to blame the other. The Maduro government said the blackout was an act of sabotage by the opposition, while Mr. Guaido's camp blamed government incompetence, corruption and underinvestment.\nMembers of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in the UK Parliament have said a technical solution to avoid checks on the Irish border after Brexit could be possible. Here's Emma Vardy. After listening to evidence from Swedish and Dutch customs consultants, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee says it believes that a technological system could be designed, trialed and piloted in under two years. That added that such a system would be a world first and would require a high degree of political trust. The endorsement of technological solutions by the committee will be welcomed by Brexiteers, but it is unlikely to influence the EU negotiators. The EU continues to insist the current backstop plan, which could mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow some EU rules. It's the only realistic solution to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland.\nMore than two hundred works of art belonging to the singer George Michael, who died in 2016, will go on display today in London ahead of being auctioned next Thursday.

        <markdown-content>This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Jonathan Izard. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied west bank if he is re-elected in the general election on Tuesday. In a television interview, he said discussions were in hand to extend sovereignty to all settlements. I'm going to extend Israeli sovereignty and I don't make a distinction between blocks of settlements and more isolated settlements. In my opinion, each block is an Israeli area and is under Israeli control. We, the Israeli government have responsibility over these areas. I won't hand them over to the Palestinian authority. The chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel would continue its brazen violation of international law, so long as the world community continued to reward it with impunity. Decades of settlement building deemed illegal by the international community is a huge stumbling block to reaching a peace deal.\nTens of thousands of Venezuelans have taken to the streets in the latest protest against President Nicolas Maduro. The opposition leader Juan Guaido who claims he is the legitimate interim president urged the crowds in Caracas to step up their campaign for change. Will Grant reports. The trembling in the presidential palace because we're in the streets Juan Guaido told thousands of his supporters who turned out in protest at the worsening crisis. Venezuela isn't afraid, he said. Only a small group is in reference to President Nicolas Maduro's inner circle. Some are struggling to find the energy to keep protesting, though, as they have to deal with the daily hardships of electricity and water shortages. For every anti-government march, there is a pro-government one. At a large rally outside the presidential palace Miraflores, President Maduro again blamed the lack of public services on unspecified terrorist attacks aimed at demoralizing and disappointing the Venezuelan people. Will Grant reporting.\nActivists have taken to the streets in Berlin to protest against soaring rents and dwindling housing stock there. They have also started collecting names for a petition demanding that local authorities expropriate properties from private landlords who own more than three thousand flats. Berliners enjoyed cheap rents after reunification, but some estimates say housing costs there have doubled over the past ten years.\nPassenger aircraft have begun flying in and out of a giant new airport in the Turkish city of Istanbul, which Turkey plans to make the biggest in the world. On Saturday, the national carrier Turkish Airlines dispatched its first flight from the airport and eight-billion-dollar project championed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News.\nPresident Trump has announced that he's replacing his Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. The President thanked her for her service, but gave no reason for the change. It follows growing anger in the White House at the failure to reduce the number of migrants entering the United States illegally across the southern border. Chris Buckler is in Washington.\nAs the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen faced widespread criticism for enforcing the Trump administration policy, which led to the separation of children from their parents at the border. Mr. Trump latter change the so-called zero tolerance approach. She will be replaced as acting secretary by Kevin McAleenan who's the current commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection.\nThe United States has demanded an immediate halt to an offensive by the Libyan war lord Khalifa Haftar on the capital Tripoli. The Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was continuing to press Libyan leaders to return to political talks mediated by the United Nations. Four days of fighting around Tripoli are reported to have left more than twenty people dead. Government forces have threatened to a counteroffensive against general Haftar's stronghold in eastern Libya.\nLondon has begun enforcing a scheme to clean up its polluted air through an ultra low emission zone for vehicles in the city centre. From today, drivers with the most polluting vehicles have to pay to drive into the central zone. Lorries and buses that aren't compliant will be charged about a hundred and thirty dollars a day. The mayor of London is Sadiq Khan.\nIn London, we've got a public health emergency. People are changing their behaviors already and the point of this policy is to lead to a bigger change of behavior. You know there are one five children in London, they go to primary school where the air is illegal. We think because of our policies we will govern situation where there are four hundred fifty schools in areas with air is illegal to five in 2020 and zero by 2025. London's mayor Sadiq Khan.\nAnimal rights activists in Australia have blocked roads and broken into abattoirs in a day of action across the country.

Other animal rights campaigners have chained themselves to equipment at abattoirs.The demonstrations marked the one year anniversary of the release of a documentarythat used hidden cameras and drones to investigate the abusive livestock in Australia. Farming groups said the film didn't reflect the practices of the industry as a whole.\nBBC world news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼尔·努内斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n特朗普总统宣布国土安全部长克尔斯滕·尼尔森将离任。总统对她所做的工作表示感谢，但并没有给出其离职原因。此前由于未能减少非法进入美国南部边境的移民人数，白宫对此日益不满。以下是克里斯·巴克勒在华盛顿的报道。\n作为国土安全部部长，克尔斯滕·尼尔森因强制执行特朗普政府的政策而广受批评，该政策导致儿童与父母在边境分离。特朗普之后修改了所谓的零容忍政策。美国海关和边境保护局局长凯文·麦卡伦南将代替她接任该部门的代理部长。\n美国要求利比亚军阀哈利法·哈夫塔尔立即停止对首都的黎波里的进攻。国务卿迈克·蓬佩奥表示，美国正继续敦促利比亚领导人重返由联合国调解的政治谈判。据报道，的黎波里四天的战争造成20多人死亡。政府部队威胁要对哈夫塔尔将军在利比亚东部的据点进行反击。\n伦敦已开始对车辆实施一项计划，该计划旨在通过在市中心建立一个超低排放区来清理污染空气。从今天开始，驾驶污染最严重车辆的司机必须付钱才能进入中心区域。不合规的卡车和公共汽车每天将收取约130美元。伦敦市长是萨迪克·汗。\n在伦敦，我们遇到了一次突发公共卫生事件，人们已经在改变他们的行为了，这一政策的重点是引导人们做出更大的行为改变。伦敦有五分之一的孩子所处的校园空气是不合规的。 我们认为，政策实行后，该地区空气质量不合规的学校会从现在的450所降到2020年的5所，再到2025年零所。以上是伦敦市长的讲话。\n澳大利亚的动物权利保护人士在一天的全国性活动中封锁了道路并闯入了屠宰场。他们在抗议农场虐待牲畜。至少有9人被捕。以下是菲尔·莫瑟的详细报道。\n抗议者扰乱了墨尔本市中心的高峰时段交通车流。其他动物权利运动者将自己锁在了屠宰场设备上。这次示威活动是为了纪念一部纪录片发布一周年，该纪录片使用隐藏式摄像机和无人机调查澳大利亚虐待牲畜的现象。农业组织表示，这部影片不能反映整个行业的做法。\nBBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC news. Israelis are voting in the country's most closely-fought general election in years. The Prime Ministe Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a record fifth term in office. His right-wing Likud party is thought to be facing a strong challenge from a centrist alliance formed by ex-military chief Benny Gantz. Tom Bateman is in Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu has pitched himself as the sole guarantor of Israel's security, but he has been dogged by looming corruption charges and a flare-up with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip saw his credentials under strain. His main challenger Benny Gantz has tried to exploit the bribery claims, pledging more honesty and political unity. The campaign has seen Mr. Netanyahu tacked further right ending with a controversial pledge that Israel would annex Jewish settlements in the occupied west bank.\nMembers of the security forces in Sudan have again attempted to break up a protest outside the army headquarters in the capital Khartoum, which is now in its fourth day. The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of President Omar al-Bashir. Anne Soy reports. Witnesses report hearing heavy gunfire and seeing people running for cover in Khartoum. It is the latest attempt by security forces to disperse thousands who have gathered outside the army headquarters since Saturday. Previous attempts to break up the protests were futile. In some instances, military officers are reported to have protected the protesters. Dramatic video emerged on Monday showing soldiers firing at an unclear target are civilians took cover behind them. The protesters said they were responding to gunfire from the security services.\nDonald Trump has criticized the decision by a federal US judge to ban the practice of sending asylum seekers to Mexico to await their court hearings. On Twitter, the president described the move as unfair to the US, saying the judge had ruled Mexico to be too dangerous for migrants.\nPresidential Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil says he is working with the United States to promote dissent within the Venezuelan military. He told Brazilian radio that the army would decide Venezuela's fate. He said the country could not be allowed to become another Cuba or North Korea.\nThe Turkish electoral commission has rejected a request of the governing AK Party for most of the votes cast in Istanbul's mayoral election to be recounted. It says votes in only fifty-one ballot boxes across the city will be reexamined. It's likely to have little effect on the opposition's estimated 15,000-vote lead.

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Daniel Yavascave with the BBC news. Anti-government protesters in Sudan have vowed to continue their demonstrations until the military hands back power to a civilian authority. Despite the appointment of Sudan's third leader in as many days, General Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan took over as head of Sudan's transitional military council late on Friday. Protesters welcomed the news but wanted more change. Reem Abbas is a writer in Khartoum. The economy is in shambles, okay. But this is why we need the government of technocrats. We don't need a transitional military council that will be unable to deliver anything. We need the right people in the right place and this is what people are saying. There are already plans in the making. People have been working for a very long time to have emergency economic plan, emergency plans for different issues. So this needs to be delivered. This is why we need a civilian government. We need to build institutions that can actually sustain and preserve democracy.\nThe North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says he will only hold a third summit with President Trump if the US changes policies. Otherwise, he said the two countries could meet a thousand times without making progress. Laura Bicker is in Seoul. Donald Trump said earlier this week that he was open to meeting Kim Jong-un again. The two leaders have met twice, but both times failed to reach a deal which would allow the US to lift economic sanctions and exchange for North Korea abandoning its nuclear and missile programs. Mr. Kim said that during the talks in Hanoi on February, the US came up with a completely unrealistic plan. He said that Washington stuck with that calculation, the path ahead would be bleak and dangerous.\nIndia is observing the centenary of a massacre by British troops that seen as one of the darkest incidents of the colonial era. On that day, soldiers commanded by General Reginald Dyer killed hundreds of unarmed people protesting against repressive laws in Amritsar. Anbarasan Ethirajan has this report. The Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and other leaders have laid wreaths at the site in Amritsar. Mr. Gandhi wrote that the cost of freedom must never ever be forgotten. On Friday night, thousands of people staged a candle-lit march to the site, observing two minutes of silence. The Jallianwala Bagh Bagh massacre became the symbol of colonial cruelty and marked a turning point in India's independence struggle. The British high commissioner to India Sir Dominic Asquith also paid his respects, expressed deep regret for the incident, but did not offer an apology as many Indians had wanted.

There's speculation that it may be linked to a two-hundred-million-dollar project to restore the nineteenth century spire. Temperatures reached eight hundred degrees Celsius. From there, Hugh Schofield sent this report. The extent of the damage to Notre Dame is both shocking and reassuring. Nearly the entire roof has been destroyed. It consisted of hundreds-of-meter thick oaken beams and was in itself a rare feat of craftsmanship. The spire too has gone, collapsing dramatically into the inferno, and some of the stone vaulting inside the cathedral has also been destroyed. But the essential structure of Notre Dame emerges from its ordeal unscathed.\nA court in Moscow has sentenced a Norwegian to fourteen years in prison on charges of spying on Russia's nuclear submarine programme. Sixty-three-year-old Frode Berg had denied the charges. Sarah Rainsfield reports. Frode Berg's lawyer said the Norwegian reacted calmly to the guilty verdicts and he now hoped diplomatic efforts will help him avoid the fourteen-year sentence he's been given. Mr. Berg has decided not to appeal his conviction, but to push for a pardon instead from president Putin. This tale of espionage has baffled observers ever since Frode Berg's arrest, accused of posting envelopes containing cash and instructions from Norwegian intelligence. Prosecutors have said the information sought concerned Russian submarines. His Norwegian lawyer has said he didn't realize the risk he was running.\nThe Russian Parliament has given its final approval to a bill creating a domestic autonomous Internet. Under the new law, it will no longer be up to local Internet providers to block access to banned information. This will now be done by the state. Critics are concerned the law will allow censorship.\nEvents have been held across South Korea to mark the fifth anniversary of the Sewol-ho ferry disaster, which killed three hundred people, most of them children. At the main ceremony held in the city of Anseong，a one minute memorial ceremony sounded followed by a silent prayer. Elsewhere, a group of buried family members took a boat to where the ferry went down.\nThere's been an angry response in Kenya to a decision by the authorities to introduce a new tax to build low-cost homes. Next month, employers and employees will have to pay the one point five percent levy, although no one will contribute more than fifty dollars a month. Correspondents say many Kenyans are opposed to the tax because of the amount of public funds that are lost to corruption.

All seven suicide bombers who were apparently implicated in some of the attacks were all local. But again, the coordinated nature of these attacks taking place in such a short space of time from each other suggest that they did get some international help from a perhaps, an international network. According to that cabinet spokesperson, authorities were aware as soon as April 11 that some sort of coordinated attack would be taking place, but the prime minister's office was not informed.\nThe Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev says Moscow has a chance to improve relations with Ukraine following Volodymyr Zelensky's victory in the presidential election over Petro Poroshenko. However, Mr. Medvedev added he had no illusions about Mr. Zelensky, a comedian with no political experience. Anastasia Gribanova is in Moscow.\nDmitry Medvedev commented on the victory of Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine but did not congratulate him. He said that there is still a chance for Ukraine to improve their relations with Russia. As for Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, he has so far neither commented on the victory or congratulated Volodymyr Zelensky. But many members of Russian parliament have already made their statements. Many of them said that people in Ukraine voted not for Zelensky but against Petro Poroshenko. Many others have sent Mr. Zelensky their congratulations, including the US President, the European Union and the head of NATO.President Trump's special representative said the US would continue to support Ukraine's efforts to restore its territorial integrity and counter Russian aggression.\nIran and Pakistan will set up a joint rapid reaction border force to counter the threat of terrorism.

Mr. Putin said the pair had discussed ways to improve what he called the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Kim described the two hours of talks in Vladivostok is meaningful.

And I think, you know, coming all this distance from Moscow to here in the far east of Russia, you kind of understand why, it's just over a hundred kilometers from here as the crow flies to the North Korean border. And I think you know Russia doesn't want an unstable, an unorthodox, some unpredictable neighbor with nuclear weapons right here on its border.\nA mass demonstration is due to take place later today in the Sudanese capital Khartoum to maintain pressure on the transitional military council to hand over to a civilian administration.

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC News. Iran's Foreign Ministry has praised the military for shooting down an American drone on Thursday, warning that no violation of the country's territorial integrity would be allowed. A spokesman said Iran would counter all aggression against it regardless of any decision by Washington. Alan Johnston reports. The US called off a planned attack on Iran on Thursday night, but tensions remain extraordinarily high and the war of words goes on. In Tehran, a Foreign Ministry spokesman praised the forces that downed the American drone and warned again that any threat to Iran would be counted. In Washington, President Trump has said that if it comes to a war, Iran would be obliterated, but he knows that all-out conflict of that kind would be fraught with the most enormous risk. It could very quickly spill out beyond Iran's borders and engulf the Middle East.\nThe German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer says right-wing extremism has become as dangerous as Islamist violence. Mr. Seehofer said the murder of a local politician in the city of Kassel by suspected far-right fanatic earlier this month had motivated him to do everything possible to increase security. Here's our Europe regional editor Mike Saunders. Horst Seehofer's political hallmark is to talk tough. First, It was illegal migration. Now It's right-wing extremism. In a newspaper interview, he said insults, slander and incitement should be prosecuted whether online or elsewhere. He said he'd look at restricting the basic rights of culprits. It's an indication of how badly the country has been shaken by the murder of Walter Lubcke, a senior Conservative, shot in the head at point-blank range at his home in central Germany this month. A forty-five-year-old suspect is in custody.\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has urged the Venezuelan government to release all political prisoners. She said she'd received permission to establish a permanent human rights office in Caracas. Mr. Maduro has promised to listen to her recommendations. People in Mauritania are voting to choose a successor to President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. He's stepping down after completing two terms in office since seizing power in a coup eleven years ago. The election marks the first time an elected leader in Mauritania has handed power to an elected successor since independence nearly sixty years ago.\nOfficials in Hawaii say all nine people on board a sky diving aircraft died when it crashed on the island of Oahu.

        <markdown-content>BBC World Service. The news with Jerry Smit.\nThe Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido says outside military force remains an option to secure a political transition. Mr. Guaido was speaking in a BBC interview.\nToday, there are some in the opposition leadership who do talk about the military option and we understand why they do. If the dictatorship won't relinquish power and keeps killing our young people and continues with their repression, then there's the option of force.\nBut Mr. Guaido added the aim would always be a transitional government and free elections. Mr. Guaido who insists he is the legitimate president, denied that his movement was losing momentum. He said Venezuelans were tired and afraid but still desired political change.\nThe South Korean President Moon Jae-in says that the United States and North Koreaare engaging in behind-the-scenes talks to set up a possible third summitbetween Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Mr. Moon rejected the idea that the second leaders' summit in Hanoi on February had been a failure. Laura Bicker has sent us this report from Seoul.\nThe South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the meeting in February served as a chance for both Washington and Pyongyang to better understand each other's positions and put everything they want on the negotiating table. There has been speculation that talks between the US and North Korea could resume since Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un exchanged personal letters. The US envoy to North Korea Stephen Biegun will arrive in Seoul on Thursday and some analysts believe he could use the trip as a chance to meet North Korean officials.\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says his country will not retreat in the face of US accusations and insults. In his first comments since President Trump imposed sanctions on him and other senior figures on Monday, he described the sanctions as cruel, but said Iran remains strong and would achieve all its goals. On Tuesday, President Trump threatened to obliterate parts of Iran if it attacked anything American. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated further since Iran shot down a US drone last Thursday.\nNew Zealand's parliament has voted in favor of a bill that could legalize voluntary euthanasia. It would allow that adults with less than six months to live or those with an irreversible medical condition could request a lethal dose of medication. The bill needs to pass through parliament for a third time before becoming law.\nSaudi Arabia has unveiled the first detailed plans for a vast entertainment resort unprecedented in the Kingdom to be built near the capital Riyadh.

        <markdown-content>**A fib**\n**小小的谎言**\nI was six years old and my sister, Sally Kay, was a submissive three.For some reason, I thought we needed to earn some money. I decided we should “hire out” as maids. We visited the neighbors, offering to clean houses for them for a quarter cents.\n那一年我6岁，听话的妹妹萨利凯只有3岁。出于某种原因，我认为我们需要挣一些钱。我觉得我们应该去“打工”做女佣。于是，我们去拜访邻居们，提出为他们打扫房子，开价25美分。\nReasonable as our offer was, there were no takers. But one neighbor telephoned Mother to let her know what Mary Alice and Sally Kay were doing. Mother had just hung up the phone when we came bursting through the back door, into the kitchen of our apartment.“Girls,”Mother asked, “ Why were you two going around the neighborhood telling people you would clean their houses?”\n虽然我们的提议合情合理，但是却没有人愿意雇用我们。并且还有一位邻居打电话给我们的母亲，告诉她玛丽艾丽丝和萨莉凯所做的事情。我们推开后门走进自家厨房的时候，母亲刚刚挂上电话。“姑娘们，”母亲问道，“你们俩为什么告诉邻居们想给他们打扫房子？”\nMother wasn’t angry with us. In fact, we learned afterwards, she was amused that we had come up wih such an idea. But, for some reason, we both denied having done any such thing. Shocked and terribly hurt that her dear little girls could be such “bold-faced liars,” Mother then told us that Mrs. Jones had just called to tell her we had been to her house and said we would clean it for a quarter.\n母亲并未生我俩的气。我们后来才知道，事实上，她为我们冒出那样的想法而觉得有趣。但不知为何，我俩一致否认做过这样的事情。没有想到两个可爱的小女儿竟然会是“厚颜无耻的撒谎精”，母亲大为震惊和伤心。然后，她告诉我琼斯太太刚刚打过电话来，告诉她我们去过她家并提出25美分为她打扫房子。\nFaced with the Truth, we admitted what we had done. Mother said that we had “fibbed.” We had not told the Truth. She was sure that we knew better. She tried to explain why a fib hurt but she didn’t feel that we really understood.\n在事实面前，我们只好承认自己的所作所为。母亲说我们“撒谎”了。我们没有说真话。她相信我们是无心之过。她尽量向我们解释为什么撒谎会伤害别人，但是她觉得我们并未真的明白。\nYears later, she told us that the “lesson” she came up with for trying to teach us to be truthful would probably have been frowned upon by child psychologists. The idea came to her in a flash… and our tender-hearted mother told us it was the most difficult lesson she ever taught us. It was a lesson we never forgot.\n数年之后，母亲告诉我们，儿童心理学家们对她随后的诚实教育的做法很可能是不赞同的。她当时也是突发奇想……温柔的母亲告诉我们，那是她对我们的教导中最困难的一次，也是我们终生难忘的一课。\nAfter admonishing us, Mother cheerfully began preparing for lunch. As we munched on sandwiches, she asked, “ Would you two like to go to th moives this afternoon?”\n在告诫完我们之后，母亲开始饶有兴致地做午餐。当我们大口咬着三明治的时候，她问我们：“今天下午，你们俩愿意去看电影吗？”\n“Wow! Would we ever!” We wondered what movie would be playing. Mother said The Matinee. Oh, fantastic! We would be going to The matinee! Weren’t we lucky? We got bathed and all dressed up. It was like getting ready for a birthday party. We hurried outside the apartment, not wanting to miss the bus that would take us downtown. On the landing, Mother stunned us by saying, “Girls, we are not going to the movies today.”\n“哇！我们当然愿意！”我们猜想要去看什么电影。母亲说是《马蒂尼》。奥，太棒了！我们要去看《马蒂尼》了！我们不是很幸运吗？我们洗了澡，穿戴整齐，就像去赴一个生日宴会一样。我们迅速出了门，去赶开往市区的公共汽车。到了车站，母亲的一句话把我们惊呆了：“姑娘们，我们今天不去看电影了。”\nWe didn’t hear her right. “What?” we objected. “What do you mean? Aren’t we going to The Matinee? Mommy, you SAID we were going to go the The Matinee!”\n我们一下没反应过来。“什么？”我们抗议道。“什么意思？我们不去看《马蒂尼》了吗？妈妈，你过说要带我们去看《马蒂尼》的！”\nMother stooped and gathered us in her arms. I couldn’t understand why there were tears in her eyes. We still had time to get the bus. But hugging us, she gently explained that this was what a fib felt like.\n母亲弯下了腰，搂住我俩。我不明白她的眼睛里为什么会有泪。我们还有时间坐公共汽车。但是，她拥抱着我们，轻声解释说这就是被谎言欺骗的感觉。\n“It is important that what we SAY is TRUE,” Mother said, “ I fibbed to you just now and it felt awful to me. I don’t ever want to fib again and I’m sure you don’t want to fib again either. People must be able to believe each other. Do you understand?”\n“说真话是非常重要的，”母亲说。“我刚才对你们撒了谎，我觉得糟透了。我不愿意再撒谎了，我相信你们也不愿意再撒谎了。人与人之间必须互相信任。你们明白了吗？”\nWe assured her that we understood. We would never forget.\n我们向她保证我们明白了。我们永远也不会忘记。\nAnd since we had learned the leeson. Why not go on to The Matinee? There was still time.\n既然我们已经接受了思想教育，为什么不接着去看《马蒂尼》呢？我们还有时间。\n“Not today,” Mother told us. We would go another time.\n“不是今天，”母亲告诉我们。我们改天去。\nThat is how, over fifty years ago, my sister and I learned to be truthful. We have never forgotten how much a fib can hurt.\n这便是50多年前我和妹妹如何学会了诚实，我们从未忘记一个谎言会造成多大的伤害。

        <markdown-content>BBC News. Hello, this is Jerry Smit.\nIran has breached the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. European signaturees have attempted to stick to the deal, despite the US withdrawal last year. Washington has since impose sanctions. Here is the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner.\nIran is being choked off economically and so far Europe has failed to convince Iran that it can offer enough of carrot to keep it within the deal.\nSo Iran is starting to ratchet up the pressure. The next step is expected on July the seventh in just six day's time when Iran has hinted that it's gonna start enriching uranium beyond the 3.6 percent, which is the cap set under this accord. Why does that matter? Because it makes it that much easier to race to the point at which you could produce a nuclear bomb.\nThe Afghan Interior Ministry says at least three people have been killed and scores injured in a car bomb attack in the Afghan capital Kabul. The blast took place in an area housing government buildings. Officials say two gunmen have been shot dead.\nThe chief executive of Safaricom, Kenya's largest telecoms firm Bob Collymore has died. He was sixty-one and has been suffering from cancer. He steered the company to unprecedented levels of profitability. The BBC's Africa business editor Larry Madowo said Mr. Collymore knew how important Safaricom was to ordinary Kenyans.\nThey feel that this is a uniquely Kenyan company and he understood that. He never tried to talk down on the citizen. He did understand that it occupies an important part of the national narrative. In a mobile phone industry where all the other competitors did make money, he made much more money than all of them combined and he was always very humble about that.\nIn the Netherlands, the man accused of shooting dead four people on the tram in the city of Utrecht in March has appeared in court for his first hearing in public. Gokmen Tanis, a Turkish-born Dutch resident faces multiple provisional charges of murder or manslaughter with terrorist intent. This report from Anna Holligan.\nGokmen Tanis wore a track suit and long beard. He was flanked by three police officers. The thirty-seven-year-old has already confessed to the killings but has refused to choose a lawyer or answer questions, telling the court he did not recognize its rules. Prosecutors said a note he left on the dashboard of a stolen car suggested a terrorist motive. It read, I do this because of my face. You are making Muslims dead. God is great!\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，大家好，我是杰瑞·施密特。 \n伊朗违反了2015年与世界大国签署的核协议所规定的浓缩铀储备限制。尽管美国去年退出该协议，但欧洲签约国仍意图遵守这项协议。华盛顿当局随后实施了制裁。以下是BBC安全通讯员弗兰克·加德纳的报道。\n伊朗在经济上受到了限制，到目前为止，欧洲未能说服伊朗其能够提供足够的好处以继续维持核协议。所以伊朗开始加大压力。下一步措施预计将于7月7日进行，也就是6天后，伊朗暗示将开始将铀的浓缩度提高至3.6％以上，3.6%是该协议规定的上限。为什么这件事这么重要？ 因为这将会让伊朗更加轻易地达到可以生产核弹的程度。\n阿富汗内政部表示，在阿富汗首都喀布尔发生的汽车炸弹袭击事件中，至少有三人死亡，数十人受伤。爆炸发生在政府大楼区域内。有关官员称两名枪手已被击毙。\n肯尼亚最大的电信公司Safaricom的首席执行官鲍勃·科利莫尔去世，享年六十一岁，且患有癌症。他带领公司达到了前所未有的盈利水平。BBC的非洲商业编辑拉里·麦朵渥称科利莫尔知道Safaricom对普通肯尼亚人的重要性。\n人们认为这是一家独特的肯尼亚公司，他明白这一点。他从不试图贬低民众。他清楚地知道该公司在民族发展进程占据着重要的部分。在所有竞争对手都赚钱手机行业，他赚的钱比所有竞争对手加起来都多，但他对此总是非常谦虚。\n在荷兰，3月份被指控在乌得勒支市的电车上枪杀4人的男子首次出庭公开听证会。土耳其出生的荷兰居民哥克曼·塔尼斯面临多项带有恐怖主义意图的谋杀或过失杀人暂时指控。以下是安娜·霍利根的报道。\n哥克曼·塔尼斯身穿田径服并留着长胡子。他被三名警察押解到了法庭。三十七岁的他已经承认杀了人，但拒绝选择律师或回答问题，并告诉法庭他不承认其法律。检察官称，在一辆被他偷来的车上，有一张纸条留在了仪表盘内，纸条表明了他的恐怖主义动机。纸条上写着，我这样做是因为我的脸。你们正在逼死穆斯林。真主万岁！\nBBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC news. In the past few minutes, Iran has confirmed that it's broken another condition of the nuclear deal reached with world powers in 2015, but says it doesn't want to abandon the agreement. At a news conference in Tehran, the deputy foreign minister said Tehran had exceeded the level of uranium enrichment set out in the deal. Earlier, the French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani to look at ways of rescuing the agreement, which has been jeopardized by US sanctions. Here's our Middle East analyst Alan Johnston. Those American sanctions are extremely comprehensive and whatever mechanism the European governments might try to fashion, the fact is multinational European companies, if they're given a choice. Do you want to trade with Iran and risk the wrath of the US Treasury, run afoul of those US sanctions laws? Those companies are always gonna choose to deal with America rather than Iraq.\nLeaked emails from the British ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, have described President Trump's administration as inept, insecure, and incompetent. Andy Moore reports. Kim Darroch writes that it's doubtful the Trump administration will ever look competent. He says you need to make your point simple, even blunt in order to get through to the president. While memo sent only last month says America's policy on Iran is incoherent and chaotic. It states Mr. Trump's public claim that he decided against attacking Iran because it would cause one hundred and fifty deaths, just doesn't stand up. The foreign office said the British public would expect their ambassadors to provide an honest, unvarnished assessment of the politics in their countries.\nThe Afghan government says eight members of the security forces have been killed and scores wounded in a bomb blast in Ghazni in the east of the country. A suicide bomber detonated a truck laden with explosives. The Taliban said they carried out the attack. African leaders are gathering in Niger today for a regional summit at which they are due to sign a landmark trade agreement. The African Continental Free Trade Area is the product of seventeen years of negotiations. Its aim is to promote a significant increase in goods exchange within Africa.\nThe head of the Egyptian Football Association Hany Abu Reida has resigned after his country was knocked out of the Africa Cup of Nations. The coach has also been sacked. Egypt, the host was beaten 1:0 by the rank outsider South Africa, who will play Nigeria in the quarter finals. And that's the latest BBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是大卫·奥斯汀，欢迎收听BBC新闻。在过去的几分钟里，伊朗已经证实它打破了2015年与世界大国达成的核协议的另一个条件，但伊朗表示不想放弃该协议。在德黑兰举行的新闻发布会上，伊朗外交部副部长表示，德黑兰方面已经超过了协议中规定的铀浓缩水平。早些时候，法国总统埃玛纽埃尔·马克龙与伊朗总统哈桑·鲁哈尼进行了交谈，研究如何挽救这项受到美国制裁破坏的协议。以下是本台的中东分析师艾伦·约翰斯顿的报道。美国的制裁是非常全面的，无论欧洲各国政府可能采取什么样的机制，事实上都是跨国欧洲公司要做出选择。你愿意与伊朗进行贸易，但要冒着激怒美国财政部，并违反美国制裁法的风险吗？这些公司总是会选择与美国合作而不是伊拉克。\n英国驻华盛顿大使金·达洛克泄露的电子邮件称特朗普总统的政府是无能，不安全和不称职的。以下是安迪·摩尔的报道。金·达洛克写道，特朗普政府的能力值得怀疑。他表示你需要把问题说的很简单，甚至是直言不讳，才能与总统接触。他上个月发送的备忘录称美国对伊朗的政策是不连贯和混乱的。这封邮件称特朗普公开声称他决定反对攻击伊朗，是因为会导致一百五十人死亡，但这经不起推敲。英外交部门表示，英国公众希望他们的大使能够对不同国家的政治进行诚实，坦率的评估。\n阿富汗政府表示，在该国东部的加兹尼省发生的炸弹爆炸中，有八名安全部队成员死亡，数十人受伤。一名自杀式炸弹袭击者引爆了一辆满载爆炸物的卡车。 塔利班称他们实施了这次袭击。\n非洲领导人今天来到尼日尔举行了一个区域峰会，他们将在该峰会上签署一项具有里程碑意义的贸易协定。非洲大陆自由贸易区是十七年谈判的产物。其目的是大幅促进非洲境内的货物交易。\n在埃及被淘汰出非洲国家杯之后，埃及足球协会的主席汉尼·阿布·瑞达宣布辞职。埃及队教练也被解雇了。埃及队作为东道主被不起眼的南非队中以1:0击败，而南非队将在四分之一决赛中与尼日利亚队比赛。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Marion Marshall with the BBC News. US media reports said the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein has been found dead in his jail cell apparently after killing himself. He was charged last month with trafficking dozens of underage girls for sex and had been due to stand trial next year. He denied the charges. Epstein was once friends with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Britain's Prince Andrew and many other wealthy and influential people. Chris Buckler reports from Washington. Jeffery Epstein was a multimillionaire and a prominent figure in wealthy social circles in the US. He founded and ran his own financial investment company. But a decade ago, he pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges in Florida and there had been controversy surrounding the plea deal he reached then with the US Attorney's office in Miami. In July, he was arrested and charged with further sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage girls. He was being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and three weeks ago, he was found in his cell with what appeared to be self-inflicted marks on his neck. Since then, he had been on suicide watch.\nDemonstrators are holding a large rally in Moscow to demand free elections, the fourth big protest in a month. It has been authorized, but the police are warning protesters not to go ahead with an unapproved march through the city centre afterwards. Our correspondent in Moscow is Sarah Rainsford. Police have warned anyone who intends to take their protests beyond here, these authorized spots, they could be arrested. They could face criminal prosecutions. So there's been a whole series of strict warnings against people heading into the city center with their protests and I think that's because these rallies have really taken the authorities here by surprise. And I think the scale of the the anger generally here is worrying for those in charge in Moscow and right up to the Kremlin.\nSouthern separated forces in Yemen appeared to have made major gains against pro-government soldiers after four days of fighting in Aden, until recently the two forces had been fighting together as part of the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi rebels. More from Sebastian Usher. The separatist fighters have concentrated their attacks on symbols of the government which normally controls Aden as its temporary capital, but still operates at least partly in exile. These include the presidential palace where the president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi is not in residence and the area where the interior minister lives, although he too is not there. The separatists say they've seized military barracks belonging to the presidential guard, some of whom seemed to have surrendered. Civilians are taking cover from mortars and trap now that some have been killed in the fighting. The violence undercuts for government's claims to authority, but also showing the fragility of the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi rebels. World news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是玛丽安·马歇尔，欢迎收听BBC新闻。美国媒体报道称，臭名昭著的金融家杰弗里·爱泼斯坦被发现死于狱中，显然是自杀身亡。他上个月被控拐卖数十名未成年少女进行性交易，原定于明年受审。他否认了这些指控。爱泼斯坦曾是比尔·克林顿、唐纳德·特朗普、英国安德鲁王子以及许多其他富有和有影响力的人的朋友。请听克里斯·巴克尔在华盛顿的报道。杰弗瑞·爱泼斯坦曾是一位千万富翁，也是美国富人社交圈中的知名人物。他创立并经营了自己的金融投资公司。但10年前，他在佛罗里达州对组织卖淫指控认罪，当时他与迈阿密美国检察官办公室达成的认罪协议引发了争议。今年7月，他被逮捕并被指控进行情节更严重的性交易，涉及数十名未成年少女。他被关押在曼哈顿的大都会惩教中心，三周前，他在牢房里被发现脖子上似乎有自残的痕迹。从那以后，他一直处于自杀监视状态。\n示威者正在莫斯科举行大规模集会，要求举行自由选举，这已是一个月来的第四次大规模抗议活动。游行已经得到批准，但警方警告抗议者活动结束后不要在市中心举行未经审核的游行。以下是本台驻莫斯科记者萨拉·雷斯福德的报道。警方警告称，任何试图在授权地点之外进行抗议活动的人都可能被逮捕。这些人还有可能面临刑事起诉。警方发布了一系列严厉的警告，警告人们不要进入市中心抗议，我认为这是因为抗议人员真的让当局感到意外。我认为，俄罗斯民众普遍的愤怒情绪令莫斯科乃至克里姆林宫的掌权者感到担忧。\n也门南部分离主义武装在亚丁与亲政府军战斗了四天之后，似乎取得了重大进展。不久前，这两支部队还在并肩战斗，作为沙特领导的联军打击胡塞叛军。以下是塞巴斯蒂安·厄舍尔的报道。分离主义武装分子将攻击目标集中在政府的标志性地点，也门政府现将亚丁作为临时首都，流亡期间仍保持部分运作。遭到袭击的地方包括总统官邸和内政部长居住的地区，尽管他们都住不在那里。分离主义武装称，他们占领了属于总统卫队的军营，其中一些人似乎已经投降。平民正在躲避迫击炮和陷阱，一些人已经在战斗中遇难。暴力活动削弱了政府的权威，也显示出沙特领导的反胡塞叛军联盟的脆弱。BBC 国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Chris Barrow with the BBC news.\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman says the attack on his country on Saturday posed a real test of the world's will to confront acts that threaten international stability. Our Middle East analyst Alan Johnston reports.\nThe Saudis are looking to rally the international community behind them in the aftermath of the attack on their oil facilities. The crown prince's remark is part of that effort, presenting what's happened is a challenge demanding a global response. The Saudis say they will soon produce evidence revealing Iran's involvement in the attack. The Iranians deny any responsibility for it. They've warned that if they are attacked, their response wouldn't be limited. They're signaling to the Saudis and their US allies that any possible military exchange would have far reaching consequences.\nSaudi Arabia's new ambassador to Britain has told the BBC that the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is a stain on his whole country. Prince Khalid Bin Bandar Al Saud said an investigation into Mr. Khashoggi's death was continuing. He was killed by Saudi state agents in Istanbul last year, which Riyadh says was a rogue operation.\nThe European Parliament has voted to call for Britain to leave the EU with the deal six weeks before its scheduled departure next month. Here's our Europe correspondent Adam Fleming.
        The European Parliament's call to avoid a no-deal Brexit was endorsed by a large but unsurprising majority of MEPs. Before-hand, they'd heard from the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, he said his meeting with Boris Johnson earlier this week left him with the impression no-deal was a real possibility. Mr. Juncker said he'd prioritize the unity of the EU suggesting he'll continue to support Ireland rather than siding with the UK to get a deal.\nUnofficial results from Israel's second general election in five months indicate that the two main parties are deadlocked. With almost all votes counted, it appears that neither the Likud party of the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor the rival Blue and White Alliance has a clear path to forming a coalition government. From Jerusalem, here's Barbara Plett-Usher.\nThe election has left Israelis confused and uncertain. Racing for fractious coalition talks that will test Benjamin Netanyahu's political instincts. The veteran survivor of Israeli politics has suffered a blow. Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't able to muster the majority to form a government. If the exit polls are right, his Likud party may even have lost seats to the opposition. That leaves him fewer options to defend against possible indictments on corruption charges, but he's nowhere close to admitting defeat.\nAt least twenty-three children have died after a fire broke out at a boarding school in Liberia. More children are missing and afeared to have been killed. The blaze broke out at a boarding house attached to a mosque on the outskirts of the capital Monrovia.\nYou're listening to the latest world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是克里斯·巴洛，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n沙特阿拉伯王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼表示，周六发生在沙特的袭击事件对世界应对威胁国际稳定行为的意愿构成了真正的考验。请听本台中东分析师艾伦·约翰斯顿的报道。\n沙特石油设施遭到袭击后，该国正寻求国际社会的支持。王储的讲话就是为了这一目的。王储称该袭击是一项需要全球作出反应的挑战。沙特称他们将很快拿出证据，证明伊朗参与了此次袭击。伊朗否认对此负有任何责任。他们警告称，如果受到攻击，他们将做出任何必要的反击。他们是在向沙特及其美国盟友发出信号，任何可能的军事行动都将产生深远的影响。\n沙特阿拉伯新任驻英国大使告诉BBC，沙特记者贾马尔·哈苏吉被杀是该国的一大污点。沙特王子哈立德·本·阿尔·萨乌德表示，对哈苏吉之死的调查仍在继续。他去年在伊斯坦布尔被沙特国家特工杀害，利雅得方面称这是一次卑劣的行动。\n欧洲议会投票要求英国在下月按现有协议脱欧，现在距离拟定脱欧时间还有六个星期。以下是本台欧洲记者亚当·弗莱明的报道。\n欧洲议会关于避免无协议脱欧的呼声得到了多数欧洲议员的支持，这并不令人意外。在之前，他们已经收到了来自欧盟委员会主席容克的消息主席表示，本周早些时候与鲍里斯·约翰逊的会面给他留下的印象是，无协议脱欧的可能性真的存在。容克表示，他将优先考虑欧盟的团结，这意味着他将继续支持爱尔兰，而不是支持英国达成协议。\n以色列五个月来第二次大选的非官方结果显示，两大主要政党陷入僵局。现在几乎所有选票都已清点完毕，看来无论是本杰明·内塔尼亚胡总理领导的利库德党，还是蓝白党都无法组建联合政府。以下是芭芭拉·普莱特-厄舍尔在耶路撒冷的报道。\n这次选举让以色列面临疑惑和不确定性。竞争联盟谈判将考验本杰明·内塔尼亚胡的政治直觉。这位以色列政坛的资深幸存者遭受了打击。本杰明·内塔尼亚胡未能召集多数席位组建政府。如果民调结果无误，他的利库德党甚至可能会输给反对党。这让他在面对可能的腐败指控时选择更少，但现在认为他已失败还为时尚早。\n利比里亚一所寄宿学校发生火灾，造成至少23名儿童死亡。还有更多儿童失踪，并有可能已经死亡。大火发生在首都蒙罗维亚郊区一座清真寺附属的公寓。\n您正在收听的是最新的BBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>BBC News. Hello, I'm Jerry Smit.\nThe British government says it's launched its biggest ever peacetime repatriation effort following the collapse of the world's oldest travel firm Thomas Cook. In total, around six hundred thousand people have been left stranded across the globe. Tom Burridge reports.\nThere were sixteen thousand people booked to fly back to the UK with Thomas Cook today. By tonight, the Civil Aviation Authority hopes to have brought at least fourteen thousand of them home. It has forty-five chartered aircraft at its disposal, equivalent in size to the UK's fifth largest airline. Many of the planes have been sought from major airlines, one of them an Airbus A380 has been brought in from Malaysia. A small number of passengers will be brought back on commercial flights. This operation has been codenamed Matterhorn. It will last roughly two weeks. Thomas Cook's German airline Condor says it will keep flying and has applied for a bridging loan.\nSpanish police say they've arrested nine Catalan separatists suspected of planning a series of violent attacks. They were detained in the early hours of Monday in various locations across the region. With more details, here's Mike Sanders.\nPolice say the suspects were planning attacks to mark the second anniversary of Catalonia's unauthorized independence referendum on October 1st. There's also tension ahead of the verdicts on twelve Catalan separatist leaders who organized the drive for independence. They deny sedition and rebellion. Reports say those arrested are in what are known as the Technical Response Team seen as the most militant arm of the Republican Defense Committees that separatists set up a month before the referendum to carry out its implementation. Police say they found material for making explosives. Separatists say there's been no violence in their campaign.\nIndonesian police are struggling to restore order in Wamena the biggest town in the easternmost province of Papua after riots broke out involving high school students. Here's Michael Bristow.\nA number of buildings, including government offices were reported to have been set on fire. Wamena's airport, the main point of access for this isolated town has also been closed. Video footage showed soldiers firing warning shots. The unrest is thought to have been sparked by allegations at a local teacher racially insulted a school pupil. A similar incident involving Papua university students studying on the island of Java also led to violent protest last month. Many people in Papua resent being part of Indonesia.\nThe Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will present a new security plan for the Gulf when he speaks at the United Nations this week. The foreign minister Javad Zarif said it would be a coalition for hope instead of a coalition for war, a reference to US plans for joint patrols to protect shipping. Saudi Arabia, the US and Britain have all blamed Iran for the recent missile and drone attack on oil facilities.\nYou're listening to world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC 新闻，大家好，我是杰瑞·施密特。\n英国政府表示，世界上历史最悠久的旅游公司托马斯·库克倒闭后，政府启动了和平时期规模最大的遣返行动。全球共有大约60万游客被滞留。以下是汤姆·布里奇的报道。\n今天有1.6万人在托马斯·库克预定了机票飞回英国。民用航空管理局希望截至今晚至少要带回一万四千名乘客。其有45架包机可用，规模相当于英国第五大航空公司。许多飞机都是来自大型航空公司，其中一架空客A380则是来自马来西亚。少数乘客将乘坐商业航班返回。这次行动代号为马特洪峰，将持续大约两周。托马斯·库克旗下的德国康多尔航空公司表示，他们将继续飞行，并申请了过渡性贷款。\n西班牙警方称逮捕了9名涉嫌策划一系列暴力袭击的加泰罗尼亚分裂分子。周一凌晨，他们在该地区多个地点被拘留。以下是迈克·桑德斯带来的详细报道。\n警方表示，嫌犯计划发动袭击，以纪念10月1日加泰罗尼亚非官方独立公投两周年。在对12名组织独立运动的加泰罗尼亚分裂主义领导人进行裁决之前，局势也很紧张。他们否认了暴乱和叛乱指控。报道称，被逮捕的人是所谓技术反应小组的成员，该小组被视为共和党国防委员会中最激进的一个分支，分裂分子在公投实施前一个月成立了该小组。警方表示，他们发现了制造爆炸物的材料。分裂分子表示，他们的运动中没有暴力。\n印尼警方正努力恢复巴布亚省东部最大城市瓦梅纳的秩序，此前这里发生了涉及高中生的骚乱。以下是迈克尔·布里斯托的报道。\n据报道，包括政府办公室在内的许多建筑被烧毁。瓦梅纳的机场，这个孤立城市的主要入口也已经关闭。视频显示士兵们正在鸣枪示警。这场骚乱被认为是由当地一名教师种族歧视一名该校学生所引发的。上个月发生了一起类似事件，其涉及到了在爪哇岛学习的巴布亚大学学生。该事件也引发了暴力抗议。巴布亚的许多人不喜欢作为印度尼西亚的一部分。\n伊朗总统哈桑·鲁哈尼将在本周联合国演讲中提出一项新的海湾安全计划。伊朗外交部长贾瓦德·扎里夫表示，这将是一个希望联盟，而不是战争联盟，他指的是美国为保护航运而提出的联合巡逻计划。沙特阿拉伯、美国和英国都指责伊朗最近对石油设施发动了导弹和无人机袭击。\n您正在收听的是BBC国际新闻。

        <markdown-content>BBC News. Hello, I'm Jerry Smit.\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry says Russia has handed back three Ukrainian ships that it seized a year ago of Crimea, the Ukrainian territory Moscow annexed in 2014. Jonah Fisher reports.\nThis is another confidence-building measure in the slowly improving relationship between Russia and Ukraine. Two months ago, the 24 sailors who were on board these three ships were returned to Kiev. Now, with the meeting between the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia confirmed for three weeks' time, the ships have been sent back to. Their return will come as a welcome boost for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. He's been criticized for the concessions he's made to try and get peace talks with Russia started.\nNorth Korea has said it's not interested in holding what it described as another fruitless summit with the United States. Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that the North Korean leader should act quickly to negotiate a nuclear deal with the US. This report from Seoul by Laura Bicker.\nNorth Korean state media claims that Pyongyang has not received a fair price for giving President Trump a summit with Kim Jong-un. It described the previous meetings between the two leaders as fruitless and claimed the talks had allowed President Trump to boast about his achievements. This statement warned Washington that North Korea will only enter into talks if the US drops its hostile policies, which may mean Pyongyang wants sanctions relief before it's willing to come to the negotiating table.\nThe Catalan leader Quim Torra has gone on trial in Barcelona in connection with the yellow ribbons and other separatist symbols on public buildings displayed before Spain's general election in April. He's accused of ignoring a court order to remove them and a banner outside the Catalan administration's headquarters calling for the release of alleged political prisoners.\nA new report from the United Nations says more than seven million children worldwide are being held in detention. The global study on children deprived of their liberty argues that detaining children can be seen as a form of violence. Imogen Foulkes is our correspondent in Geneva.\nWhat the UN is saying is that in the countries where children are detained, because they are problematic, for example, because they have alcohol problems or drug problems or they've committed some crime; that still custodial sentences should be a measure of complete last resort and that there are nearly always better solutions in a family setting. And they point out that all evidence shows that a family setting for children with problems is a much better thing for their future health and development than putting them into custody.\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻。大家好，我是杰瑞·施密特。\n俄罗斯外交部表示，俄罗斯归还了三艘一年前从克里米亚扣押的乌克兰船只，而克里米亚是2014年被莫斯科吞并的乌克兰领土。请听乔纳·菲舍的报道。\n这是又一个在俄罗斯和乌克兰之间建立信任的措施，两国关系正缓慢改善。两个月前，这三艘船上的24名船员被送回基辅。现在，随着乌克兰和俄罗斯总统之间的会晤已经确认了三周时间，船只也已经被送回。船只的回归对乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基来说是一个可喜的鼓舞。他曾因与俄罗斯开启和平谈判做出让步而受到过批评。\n朝鲜表示对与美国举行另一次毫无结果的峰会不感兴趣。唐纳德·特朗普周日在推特上表示，朝鲜领导人应迅速采取行动，与美国就核协议进行谈判。请听劳拉·比克在首尔的报道。\n朝鲜官方媒体称，平壤方面没有收到合理的条件，因此金正恩不会与特朗普举行峰会。朝鲜官方媒体表示两国领导人之前的会晤毫无结果，并声称会谈让特朗普总统得以吹嘘自己的成就。这份声明警告华盛顿方面，朝鲜只有在美国放弃其敌对政策的情况下才会加入谈判，这可能意味着平壤方面希望先解除制裁，然后才愿意坐到谈判桌前。\n加泰罗尼亚领导人奎姆·托拉已在巴塞罗那接受审判，原因是他与4月份西班牙大选前在公共建筑上悬挂黄丝带和其他与分裂有关的象征物。他被指控无视法院将其移除的命令，另外加泰罗尼亚政府总部外要求释放政治犯的横幅仍然存在。\n联合国的一份新报告称，全世界有700多万儿童被拘留。关于儿童被剥夺自由的全球研究认为，拘留儿童可以被视为一种暴力形式。以下是本台记者伊莫金·福克斯在日内瓦的报道。\n联合国表示，有一些国家会拘留问题儿童，例如，他们有酒精或毒品上瘾问题，或者是他们犯了某种罪。监禁判决仍然应该作为一种不得已的手段执行，而且在家庭环境解决中会是更好的办法。他们指出，所有的证据都表明，对问题儿童来说，家庭环境相比拘留所对他们未来的健康和发展要好的多。\nBBC新闻。

        <markdown-content>Hello, I'm Daniel Yavoyaska with the BBC News. Two Western hostages held by Taliban militants for more than three years have been freed as part of a prisoner exchange agreed with the Afghan government. The release of an American Kevin King and an Australian came after the Taliban confirmed that three of its senior commanders had landed in Qatar. Shovi Shriffy in Kabul has this assessment. The swap includes Anas Haqqani, a leading figure and fundraiser in the Haqqani militant group and two other senior commanders. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has called this a tough but important decision. It really is indeed a good gesture from both sides and it's hoped that the immediate impact of this deal would be a reduction in violence and hopefully leading to resumption of peace talks, including the Taliban accepting the Afghan government to sit on the negotiation table with them face-to-face.\nThe Lebanese Parliament has been forced to postpone a debate on a controversial amnesty law, which critics say could have allowed corrupt officials to evade justice. Anti-government protesters are hailing this as a victory. Sebastian Usher reports from Beirut. Protesters in Beirut have been determined to stop the parliamentary session going ahead. They blocked roads from early in the morning while the security forces have been mobilized in strength. The two sides have been facing off against each other at various points around the center of the capital. Lines of women have again stood in front of a police as a kind of buffer zone. Rumors have gone around that MPs have tried to get in inside ambulances, while at least one tried by motorbike, but only a handful appeared to have made it and the session has now been cancelled.\nThe UN says reports from Iran suggest that dozens of people may have been killed in days of protests that was sparked by a sharp rise in petrol prices. A human rights spokesman in Geneva expressed deep concern at the use of live ammunition by the security forces. He also called on the authorities to restore internet services. There have been reports of protesters setting ablaze banks and petrol stations in cities across the country.\nGerman prosecutors say special forces in Berlin have arrested a radical Islamist suspected of the plotting to blow up as many people as possible. They said he had in recent months bought the chemicals needed to make an unstable explosive that takes a long time to prepare. Prosecutors said the suspect had also sought information in internet chat rooms on how to make bombs.\nIndia's Upper House of Parliament is reviewing the new uniform for its marshals after the outfits for criticized for looking too military. The new design complete with gold aiguillette and brass buttons quickly drew alarm from MPs and military officials. The former Indian Army Chief General VP Malik tweeted a spot of the difference picture of the two outfits side by side, pointing out that copying military uniform is illegal in India.

        <markdown-content>BBC News. Hello, I'm Jerry Smit. Scientists have warned that climate change and pollution are reducing oxygen in the oceans threatening fish species, including tuna, marlin and sharks. The researchers found that around 700 ocean sites are now suffering from low oxygen compared with 45 in the 1960s. Matt McGrath reports. This study highlights the growing threat from climate change. As the world warms, around 90% of the excess heat goes into the oceans. Warmer waters hold less oxygen. In tropical regions, the losses range up to 40% of the dissolved gas in some locations. The loss of oxygen tends to favor species like jellyfish. But bigger fish, like tuna who need more energy, have to move to shallower waters, where oxygen is more plentiful, making them more vulnerable to overfishing. The best solution, say researchers, is to halt nutrient runoff and curb greenhouse gases.\nFirefighters in Australia have warned that a huge fire about an hour's drive from the country's most popular city could take weeks to put out. The mega-blaze north of Sydney stretches for 60 kilometers. Here's Phil Mercer. Sydney is again shrouded in a toxic smoky haze. Health warnings have been issued and many weekends' sporting activities have been cancelled. Several blazes have combined to create a 40-mile mega fire to the north of Australia's biggest city. There are 95 bush fires in drought-hit new South Wales, half are burning out of control. Authorities say that only heavy rain will put some of the fires out, but ominously, the forecast is for more hot and dry conditions.\nAn Indian woman who was attacked and set on fire on her way to testify against her alleged rapists has died of her injuries. The 23-year-old was traveling to court in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh on Thursday when she was set upon. Doctors said she suffered 90% burns.\nOne of the world's most popular discussion websites Reddit says it believes a counseling to Russia were involved in the leak of sensitive documents detailing trade talks between Britain and the United States. The dossier has been used by the opposition Labor leader Jeremy Corbin in the campaign for next week's general election. Joe Tidy reports. When Jeremy Corbin unveiled the classified material, it sparked a fierce debate about the future of the NHS. It also prompted cyber security researchers to begin investigating where the leak had come from. It didn't take long for fingers to be pointed at Russia. The tactics and methods seem to mirror those seen in previous cases. And now Reddit, the website where the documents first surfaced has banned the discussion page and 61 separate accounts. The website security team says they broke policies around voter manipulation. World news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻。大家好，我是杰瑞·施密特。科学家警告称，气候变化和污染正在减少海洋中的氧气，威胁包括金枪鱼、马林鱼和鲨鱼在内的鱼类物种。研究人员发现，现在约有700处海域缺氧，相比之下，上世纪60年代只有45处。以下是马特·麦格拉思的报道。这项研究强调了气候变化带来的日益严重的威胁。随着世界变暖，大约90%的额外热量进入了海洋。水温越高，含氧量越少。热带地区的一些海域的溶解气体减少了40%。缺氧有利于水母这样的物种。但对大型鱼类不利，比如需要更多能量的金枪鱼，不得不迁移到较浅的水域，那里的氧气更充足，但使它们更容易被过度捕捞。研究人员表示，最好的解决办法是停止养分的流入和控制温室气体。\n澳大利亚消防员警告称，距离该国最受欢迎的城市大约一小时车程的地方发生了大火，可能需要几个星期才能扑灭。悉尼北部的大火绵延了60公里。以下是菲尔·默瑟的报道。悉尼再次笼罩在有毒的烟雾之中。当局已经发布了健康警告，多个周末体育活动已经取消。澳大利亚最大城市北部发生几起火灾，大火连成一片，足有40英里长。受干旱影响的新南威尔士州共有95处丛林火灾，其中一半已失去控制。有关部门表示，只有大雨才能扑灭部分大火，但不幸的是，天气预报说还会有更多的干热天气。\n一名印度女性在前往指证强奸嫌犯的途中被袭击并被纵火烧伤，目前她已因伤势过重死亡。周四，这名23岁的女子在前往北方邦法院的途中遭到袭击并被烧伤。医生说她全身90%被烧伤。\n世界上最受欢迎的论坛网站之一Reddit表示，它认为俄罗斯的一名顾问参与了泄露英国和美国之间贸易谈判的敏感文件。英国下周举行大选，反对党工党领袖杰里米·科尔宾现已在竞选活动中使用了这份文件。以下是乔·泰迪的报道。杰里米·科尔宾公布这些机密材料时，引发了一场关于英国医疗服务的未来的激烈辩论。这也促使网络安全研究人员开始调查泄密文件的来源。没过多久，矛头就指向了俄罗斯。这些战术和方法似乎与以前的案例相似。现在，文件最初出现的Reddit网站已经关闭了这个讨论页面并封禁了61个个人账户。Reddit安全团队表示，他们违反了有关操纵选民的政策。BBC国际新闻。

Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.\n好啦，火鸡烧焦了。土豆毁了，土豆毁了，土豆毁了。\nRoss: Here we come, walking down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.\n“我们沿着……”？妈妈的厨房可不是这个味。\nMonica: No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, you got one.\n不像是吧？你不是要土豆块吗，Ross？好，拿去，伙计。\nRoss: Don't yell at me. You burned dinner!\n不要对我吼，是你把晚饭毁了。\nPhoebe: Hey, don't make her squeak again!\n嗨，不要让她再发飙啦！\nRachel: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.\n噢，天哪，飞机已经飞走了，看来我只能留下来和你们呆在一起了。\nJoey: Hey, we all had better plans. Okay? This was nobody's first choice.\n我们本来都有更好的计划的，这不是大伙的最佳选择。\nMonica: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?\n噢，真的吗？那我何苦为什么做这顿丰盛的感恩节大餐？！\nJoey: You call that delicious?\n你管这叫丰盛吗？\nMonica: Stop it, stop it, stop it!\n闭嘴，闭嘴，闭嘴！\nChandler: Now this feels like Thanksgiving.\n终于有了点感恩节的气氛了。\nRachel: Skiing. Shoop, shoop, shoop…\n哦，滑雪，咻，咻，咻…\nMonica: Shoop!\n咻。\nPhoebe: Ewww.\n额！\nRachel: What?\n什么？\nPhoebe: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.\n丑陋裸男正从烤炉中取出他的火鸡。\nRachel: Who cares?\n谁在乎啊？\nPhoebe: He just sat in gravy. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.\n他刚刚坐到肉汤里了。噢，我的天。丑陋裸男不是一个人， 他正和一个丑陋裸女共进感恩节晚餐\nJoey: I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!\n我得看看。丑陋裸男真爽！\nMonica: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!\n哦，他们跳舞了！\nPhoebe: It's nice that he has someone.\n有人陪真好。\nChandler: Shall I carve?\n可以切了吗？\nRachel: By all means.\n当然可以。\nChandler: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?\n谁想要浅色起司，谁想要深色起司？\nRoss: I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.\n我一点也不想知道深色起司是怎么来的\nMonica: Does anybody wanna split this with me?\n有人想要和我分这块吗？\nJoey: Oh, I will.\n噢，我要。\nPhoebe: Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.\n你们必须先许个愿望。\nMonica: Make a wish?\n许愿？\nPhoebe: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.\n来吧，这是感恩节！\nPhoebe: Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?\n噢！你得到大半了。你许的什么愿？\nJoey: The bigger half.\n得到大半。\nChandler: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great. I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\n我敬各位一杯。来一杯，叮叮。我知道这不是你们本来计划的感恩节， 但是对我来说这样也挺棒的。我想，这是因为它没和离婚或者呕吐沾边。不论如何，我在想，如果你去了韦尔，如果你们和父母在一起，如果你没有得“梅毒”那些玩意我们就不能一起过。所以我想说的就是：谢天谢地你们的感恩节计划都砸了。\nAll: That's so sweet.\n真是感人！\nRoss: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.\n来，祝你们有个讨厌的圣诞节。\nRachel: And a crappy New Year.\n还有一个糟糕的新年。\nChandler: Here, here!\n干！干！

What is wrong with New Year's?\n苍天！怎么了？ 过新年有什么不对吗？\nChandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday. Desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops! ! Man, I'm talking loud!\n你当然没事，你有保罗，不用面对新年带来的压力。不用焦虑地见嘴就上，就为了在落球仪式时有个亲吻的对象。天啊，我太焦虑了。\nRachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.\n告诉你吧，这个新年保罗会待在罗马，所以我和各位一样悲哀。\nPhoebe: Yeah, you wish.\n想得美。\nChandler: I got an idea, dinner.\n我倒有一个主意，吃晚餐！\nRoss: It's perfect, we will put it between lunch and breakfast.\n好极了，我们可以把它放在早饭和午饭之间。\nChandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us...dinner.\n我只是再也不想做被新年典礼冷落的受害者了。所以我们不如一起约定，拒绝一切约会，就我们6个共进晚餐。\nAll: Sure. I'll do that.

I made a man with eyes of coal and a smile so bewitching. How was I supposed to know that my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la. My mother's ashes. Even her eyelashes are resting in a little yellow jar. And sometimes when it's breezy...I feel a little sneezy. And now I...Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?\n谢谢大家，我想用一首对我意义重大的歌曲开场。我造了一个人，煤炭做的眼睛，伴着令人着迷的微笑。母亲死在了厨房，这我怎会预料。啦啦啦啦啦啦啦。母亲的骨灰，甚至连同她的睫毛，都安放在一个黄色的小罐中。有时阵阵凉风起，我有点想打喷嚏。然后...喂，等一下，噪音男孩们！ 你们有什么想和大家分享的吗？\nMax: No. No, that's...that's okay.\n没...没事\nPhoebe: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!\n说说吧，如果你们的事情重要到非在我演唱时讨论，我觉得有必要让大家都听听。\nChandler: That guy's going home with a note!\n那家伙看来得带个注意事项回家了。\nDavid: Noth...I was...I was just saying to my\n我只是在告诉我朋友...\nPhoebe: Could you speak up please?\n大声点行吗？\nDavid: Sorry, I wa...I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in...in my life. And then he said that...you said you thought Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life. and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in...in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of hard quality. And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way. You are luminous with a kind of delicate grace. Then that's when you started yelling.\n抱歉，我刚才跟我朋友说你是我见过最漂亮的女子。然后他，他说，他认为黛瑞汉娜是他见过的最漂亮的女子。是，我非常喜欢《美人鱼》里的她，但是在《华尔街》里就不那么出色了，不过她还是很有气质的...黛瑞汉娜是传统的美，而你散发出的是优雅的美。讲到这你就开始冲我们喊了。\nPhoebe: Okay, we're gonna take a short break.\n好吧，我们休息片刻。\nJoey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!\n这把那家伙不止能带个注意事项回家了。\nRoss: Come here, Marcel. Sit here.\n过来，马赛尔，坐这儿。\nRachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! Ooh, Did I just share too much? Ross: Just a smidgen. David's like, y'know, a scientist Guy. He's very methodical.\n菲比，我不敢相信他还没吻过你。我第6次与保罗约会时他就为我双峰取了名字。额，是我分享的太多了吗？ 一点点。大卫毕竟是科学家，做事一板一眼。\nMonica: I think it's romantic.\n我觉得挺浪漫的。\nPhoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see 'An Officer and a Gentleman'? Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except...he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just wanna be with him all the time. You know, day and night, and night and day, and special occasions.\n我也是！你们看过《军官与绅士》吗？我会想和他这样的男人去看这部电影。除了，额，他很聪明、很绅士，还很贴心......我只想整天和他厮守在一起，不管白天还是夜晚，夜晚还是白天，以及一些特殊的节日......\nChandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.\n等等，等等，我知道了，你想邀他共度新年，对不对？你想放我们鸽子，她想放我们鸽子。\nPhoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?\n不不不，不是……好吧，是的，可以吗？\nChandler: Yeah, because I already asked Janice.\n可以，因为我已经约了詹妮丝。\nAll: Oh! What? !\n什么！？\nRoss: Come on, this was a pact! This was your pact!\n这可是个约定！这是你提出的约定！\nChandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.\n我毁约了，行吗？我耐不住寂寞，我掉链子了！\nMonica: Yeah, but Janice? That...that was like the worst breakup in history.\n可那是詹妮丝啊…你们分手时的糟糕情况简直史无前例。\nChandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!\n我没说这是个好主意， 我说我掉链子了。\nJoey: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.\n嗨，不好意思，我来晚了。\nChandler: Too many jokes...must mock Joey.\n实在太滑稽了，快来嘲笑Joey！\nJoey: Nice shoes, huh?\n鞋子正点吧？\nChandler: Aah, you are killing me!\n笑死我算了！\nMonica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!\n罗斯！ 它又在玩我的饭铲。\nRoss: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?\n放松，它又不会把它们玩坏的。\nMonica: Do you always have to bring him here?\n你非要每次都带它来不可吗？\nRoss: Look, I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We...we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he threw some faeces...\n我不想让它独守空房，我们今早才吵了一架。一定是我加班到太晚的原因。 我说了不该说的话，它就朝我扔了些排泄物……\nChandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.\n如果你要加班，我可以替你照顾它。\nRoss: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.\n太好了，不过你要表现出一副你主动照顾它的样子，不要让它觉得你是在帮我的忙。\nChandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.\n好，但它如果问起，我可就要实话实说了。\nDavid:But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.\n但我们仍无法测试这个理论，因为现在的粒子加速器远不能模拟出这些情况。\nPhoebe: Okay, alright, I have a question, then.\n好，我倒有个问题。\nDavid: Yeah?\n什么？\nPhoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?\n你打算过要亲我吗？\nDavid: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. and, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you. Phoebe: Sure. Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... DSweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.\n这是个正当而合理的问题。答案是…是的， 是，我想过。但我要让这种非凡的事情发生在非凡的时刻，因为是你啊。当然。但等得越久，这个吻就需要显得越非凡，而此时此刻，我想，我需要…扫去桌上的一切，将你丢到桌子上，但我不是那种会扫去一切，猴急的男人。\nPhoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella. I mean, you're a sweeper!...trapped inside a physicist's body.\n大卫，我想你是的，你是被困在物理学家体内的猛男。\nDavid: Really?\n真的？\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.\n没错，我敢肯定，行动吧，扫去一切，将我丢上去吧。\nDavid: Now? Now?\n在这？现在？\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, right now.\n对，现在。\nDavid: Okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. and I'll take...this was a gift.\n好的，来吧...不过这东西很贵的，还有这个，是别人送的。\nPhoebe: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.\n额，你这是在清理场地。\nDavid: Okay, okey, what the hell, what the hell.\n好吧，管他呢。\nDavid: You want me to actually throw you or you you wanna just hop?\n你想让我丢你上去还是自己跳上去？\nPhoebe: I can hop.\n我自己跳好了。\nRoss: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?\n告诉我，'没有约会的约定' 对你们的意义何在？\nMonica: Okey, look, I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.\n抱歉，不过钱德勒找了人，菲比也有对象了，所以我决定约搞笑巴比。\nChandler: Fun Bobby? Your exboyfriend Fun Bobby?\n搞笑巴比？你那前任男友搞笑巴比？\nMonica: Yeah.\n对啊。\nJoey: You know more than one Fun Bobby?\n你还认识其他的搞笑巴比吗？\nChandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob.\n我恰巧认识一个搞笑鲍勃。\nRachel: Okay, here we go... Joey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk! There! Now there is.\n给你。 太满了，我没法加牛奶了。现在好了。\nRoss: Okay, so on our nodate evening, three of you now are going to have dates.\n所以在这个原本没有约会的晚上，你们三人都另有节目了。\nJoey: Uh, four.\n四个。\nRoss: Four.\n四个...\nRachel: Five.\n是五个。\nRoss: Five.\n五个...\nRachel: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.\n没办法，保罗提早搭飞机回来。\nJoey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?\n而我在商场遇到一个很性感的单身妈妈， 让我这个小精灵怎能抗拒？\nRoss: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?\n这么说大球落下的时候我是唯一的一个孤零零的家伙？\nRachel: Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no one'll know who's with who.\n不会的，到时候我们将开个盛大的派对，没有人知道谁和谁是一对儿。\nRoss: They will all know. Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.\n大家肯定都知道！唉，这可不是我现在需要的情况。\nMonica: What's the matter?\n出什么事了？\nRoss: Oh, it's...it's Marcel. He's angry with me again. I have no idea why, he keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...\n还不是马赛儿，它又生我的气了。我不知道为什么，它一直不让我进门，还拖着手不断绕圈子……\nChandler: That's so weird. I had such a blast with him the other night.\n奇怪，我那天晚上还跟它相处得很愉快。\nRoss: Really. Chandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV...that juggling thing is amazing. What, uh...what juggling thing?\n真的？ 是啊，我们一起玩，一起看电视，它杂耍的时候简直棒极了。什么杂耍？\nChandler: With the balledup socks? I figured you taught him that. Ross: No. Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks...and a melon...\n把袜子团起来当球耍，我以为那是你教它的。 我没有。其实也不算什么，只是拿袜子当球耍罢了...还耍了一颗香瓜。\nMax: Phoebe. Hi.\n你好，菲比。\nPhoebe: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?\n嗨！马克斯，认识这儿的人吗？\nMax: No. Have you seen David?\n不认识，你看见大卫了吗？\nPhoebe: No, no, he hasn't been around.\n没有，他没在这儿。\nMax: Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags.

Ross?\nCarol，Carol，亲爱的，深呼吸。我知道你很惶恐，但是往长远想想，生产过程只是一天。结束之后我们这辈子都是他的父母了。我是说，怀胎生子为的不就是这些吗？Ross？Ross？\nRoss: I'm gonna be a father.\n我要当爸爸了。\nRachel: It's just occurring to you?\n你才刚知道吗？\nRoss: I always knew I was having a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me.

But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.\n或许吧。但是这也无法解释他们为什么总是拿走我的剪刀。\nChandler: Uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise.\n啊，这样，可能是因为你被升职的缘故。\nNina: I am?\n我升职了？\nChandler: Sure.

And she, you know, kind of stole him away and then broke his heart. Then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, you know, or anything, but...\n好吧，我当时的状况就是这样。她呢，她把他抢走又伤了他的心。他从此不和我说话。因为他说他不愿再见像她的人。我知道Joey不是我男朋友或者热水壶或其他的什么，但是……\nChandler: You're not gonna lose him.\n你不会失去他的。\nMonica: You gotta talk to Joey.\n你得跟Joey谈谈。\nPhoebe: Yeah.\n没错。\nRoss: Come on, he doesn't know this stuff.

Italian guy's gay roommate brings home dry-cleaning.\n四月十八日，噪音过度…意大利佬的同性恋室友，带了干洗衣服回家。\nChandler: Well that's excellent.\n真是太好了。\nRachel: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.\n看看这盏灯真是够俗了，我们一定要带回去！\nMonica: Rach, I think we have enough regular lamps.\n我们有足够的正常台灯了。\nRachel: What? Come on, it's not like, it's not like I'm asking for this girlie clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.\n什么？好啦，我又不是…要这个美女时钟或什么的，但我觉得这个也很酷。\nMonica: It doesn't go with any of my stuff.\n听着，它与我的东西都不搭配。\nRachel: Well, what about my stuff?\n那么我的东西呢？\nMonica: You don't have any stuff.\n你没有任何东西。\nRachel: This will be the start of my stuff.\n这个将成为我的东西。\nMonica: Mmmm....no!\n不。\nRachel: You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?\n你还是认为那是你的公寓，对不对？\nMonica: No.\n不。\nRachel: Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just someone who rents a room.\n对，你是这么想。你把它想成是你的公寓，我只是租了个房间。\nMonica: Mmmmm.\n嗯...\nRachel: Ok, while you "mmm" on that for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.\n你支支吾吾的时候，我会为我的新台灯找个地方放。\nRoss: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?\n菲比。看我玩这些小玩具可对立的拇指！没有进化论，怎么发展出可对立的拇指？\nPhoebe: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.\n也许外星主宰需要这样的拇指才能够驾驶空间飞船。\nRoss: Please tell me you're joking.\n请说你是在开玩笑。\nPhoebe: Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.\n能不能说你相信进化论，而我不相信？\nRoss: No, no, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because it's like math. One plus one equals two. I can't stand by and let you think that one plus one might equal three or four or yellow!\n不行，菲比。就像数学，1加1等于2。我不能让你认为等于3，或者等于4，或者等于黄颜色！\nPhoebe: Why not? No, what's that all about? What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you?\n为什么不行？这有什么关系？为什么非得强迫每个人都同意你？\nPhoebe: You know what, I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.\n你知道吗？我想你，也许应该把罗斯放到显微镜下面好好看看。\nRoss: Is there blood coming out of my ears?\n我耳朵有没有流血？\nJoey: Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.\n看看这个，哈克的高中同学录。\nChandler: Wow, he looks so normal.\n他看起来好正常！\nPhoebe: He's even kinda cute.\n甚至有点可爱。

        <markdown-content>Hey Eddie. Daahh! ! What're you doing here?\n嗨，艾迪。啊，你在这里干什么？\nNothing roomy, just watching you sleep.\n没什么啊，只是看你睡觉。\nWhy?\n为什么？\nMakes me feel um, peaceful, hehheh, please.\n看你睡觉让我觉得...平静。你接着睡吧。\nI can't sleep now.\n你在这我睡不着啊！\nYou want me to sing?\n要不要我唱摇篮曲？\nNo, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.\n够了，你在这住的时间到头了。你搬出去，我要你现在就给我搬出去！\nWoah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talking about man.\n你说什么呢，老兄？\nHannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.\n汉尼拔·莱克特（《沉默的羔羊》中的食人魔）当室友都好过你。\nNo. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh?\n我觉着你说这话不公平！你看到我一次就怕了，还有好多夜里你没看到我呢？\nWhat about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?\n比如说你昨夜里起来喝水，我还好心躲在门后没让你看到呢，那又怎么说呢？\nI didn't realize that. Yeah.\n我还真不知道这些。对。\nGET OUT NOW! !\n马上滚！\nOk, you really want me out?\n真的要我出去？\nYes please.\n对，请你快出去。\nOk, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.\n那我要听到你说，我要听到你说，你要我出去。\nI want you out.\n我要你出去。\nNo no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.\n不不不。我要听到你的嘴说。\nWhere did you hear it from before?\n刚才是我哪儿跟你说的？\nOh, right, all right, you know what pally, I understand, consider me gone, you know what I'll do? I'll go move into my brother's basement and when he finds out I'll go find some place else.\n好的，好的，我懂了，知道吗？我走。知道我会做什么吗？我会搬到我兄弟的地下室去。等他发现了，我再找地方。\nYou know what? I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow. I heard that.\n知道吗？我会在你明天下班前搬走。我听到了。\nHey. Hey.\n嗨。嗨。\nHey. Wheell, look at you, finally got that time machine working huh?\n哇，看看你！终于用时光机回到过去了啊？（Joey 戴了一顶老式帽子）\nSeriously, you like it? This guy was selling 'em on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I thought, you know what I don't have?\n说真的，你觉得怎么样？有个人在第八大道上卖帽子，我看见以后就想，你知道我缺什么吗？\nA mirror?\n镜子？\nFine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.\n你就笑话我吧，我觉得很时髦。\nWow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.\n哇，对于一个刚失业的人来说，你心情很好啊。\nHey, I'll be all right. I mean it's not like I'm starting from square one. I was Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cachet.\n不要紧的，我又不是要从头开始，我可是《我们的日子》里面的德瑞克雷莫瑞大夫。那可以算是项储备吧。\nCachet? Jaunty?\n储备？时髦？\nChandler gave me word of the day toilet paper.

It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.\n瑞秋，这本书你一定要看。书名是《掌握自己的风》，讲的是女人需要拥有更多的权力。\nYeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes our wind? Men, they just take it.\n对，但是有风，风能够让我们成为女神。知道谁夺走我们的风吗？是男人。他们就那样夺走了。\nMen just take our wind?\n男人夺走我们的风？\nYahuh, all the time, 'cause they are the lightning bearers.\n对啊，一直如此。因为他们是闪电使者。\nWow. Yeah.\n哇哦。对。\nWell that sounds kinda cool, it's kinda like The Hobbit.\n听起来挺酷啊。有点像是霍毕特人啊（《指环王》中的穴居小矮人）。\nIt is nothing like the Hobbit. God it's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, exexcept for Richard.\n跟霍毕特人不沾边，就像是在读我的每一段感情。跟理查的除外。\nOh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.\n嗯，对，理查绝不会偷走你的风。\nNo.\n是啊。\nNo, 'cause he's yummy.\n因为他很可口。\nYes. But all the other ones.\n是啊，但是其他人都会。\nOh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from our pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.\n是啊。还有他们总是吸走我们储存的内在能量，但我们连尝一口都不准。\nAnybody want a cruller?\n谁要吃块长条糕？\nOk, this is a typical lightningbearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my phallic shaped man cakes?'\n看，这就是典型的闪电使者行为。就是他这样，就像是说，“嗨，谁要来一根我的老二形状的蛋糕？”。\nWho have you been dating?\n你跟谁约会了？\nDon't worry about it already. Things happen.\n别担心！人有祸福。\nSo, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?\n所以我这次被炒鱿鱼，你不生气吗？\nJoey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?\n乔伊，看着我，看着我！我牙上有口红印吗？\nNo, can we get back to me?\n没有。说回到我的问题上，好吗？\nLook honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.\n听着，亲，这一行到处有人被炒鱿鱼。我已经帮你搞到了《另一个世界》的试镜机会。\nAll right. Cab driver number two?\n太棒了！计程车司机乙？\nYou're welcome.\n不用谢哈。\nBut I was Dr. Drake Ramoray. How can I go from being a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?\n我可是演过德瑞克雷莫瑞大夫的。怎么能一下从神经外科医生变成计程车司机呢？\nHey, there was a time when I used to play pickle tickle with Rick Harrison. Things change, roll with them.\n我还曾经跟雷克斯哈里森搭档演过小淘气呢。世事无常，随遇而安吧。\nBut this is a twoline part, it's like taking a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.\n但这角色就两句台词！这可是开倒车。我不要演这个。\nJoey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.\n乔伊，我跟你说，这话我也跟过艾尔明泽和他的金字塔狗群说过。有什么就做什么，不要随地乱搞。\nI'm sorry. See ya.\n不好意思。改天见。\nOh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so\n天啊，天啊，这本书真...\nIsn't it?\n没说错吧？\nUhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book couldcould've been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.\n感觉就像是在读我自己的人生啊！这本书甚至可以叫做《掌握自己的风，瑞秋！》。\nI don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would've made a nice gift for you.\n那样的话就不会卖一百万本了，但要当礼物送给你倒蛮合适的。\nHi, guys.\n嗨，大家伙儿。\nHey.\n嗨。\nUh, sweetie we've gotta go.\n亲爱的，我们得走了。\nNO!\n我不走。\nNo?\n不走？\nNo, why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?\n不走！为什么我们做什么事都得照你的时间表来呢？\nActually it's the movie theatre that has the timetable. So you don't miss the beginning.\n事实上，我们照的是电影院的时间表。这样我们才不会错过电影开头啊。\nNo, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.\n不，这不是电影院的事儿，而是你偷了我的风。\nYou go girl. I can't pull that off can I?\n加油，姑娘！我就做不到她那样，是吧？\nExcuse me, your, your, your wind?\n什么？你的，你的风？\nYes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?\n对，我的风。你不让我吹，我怎么成长？\nYou, you know I, I don't, have a have a problem with that.\n你知道我不介意你“吹”啊。\nOk, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.\n好吧，我只是很需要一个人静一静。很抱歉。\nUmum, umum.\n咳咳。\nYou're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damn it!\n没错，我不需要跟他道歉。抱歉。该死！\nWhat is it?\n怎么了？\nI, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.\n不知道啊。就是关于什么风呀树呀，还有什么神圣的池塘。我真没弄明白，但她很生气。\nSee, this is why I don't date women who read.\n这就是为什么，我不跟看书的女人约会。\nUh oh.\n啊哦。\nWhat, what's that?\n那是什么？\nIt's my VISA bill. 'Envelope one of two.' That can't be good.\n我的信用卡帐单。两封里的一封。感觉不妙啊。\nOpen it, open it.\n打开看看，打开看看。\nOh my God.

What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.\n但是我不知道啊。我只知道你欠“缤纷世界”2300块。\nHey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.\n罗斯，我知道我欠多少。\nOk, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.\n那就讲一点道理啊。你奋斗了十年才得到医生那个大角色。谁知道下一个机会还要等多久？\nLook, I don't wanna hear this right now.\n我现在不想听这个！\nHuh, I'm just saying...\n我只是说...\nWell don't just say.\n那就别“只是说”！\nYa know, maybe, maybe I should just go.\n或许我该走了。\nOk.\n好啊。\nOk.

Look, Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?\n大概是因为上一条是培珀莉农场（知名饼干公司）做的吧。艾迪，是不是有件事你现在必须要去做呢？\nWell, not unless it's got something to do with the hydrating, my man, 'cause right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!\n除非是跟脱水有关的。因为我现在是脱水狂！\nLook you have to help me out here.

It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.\n哦，你知道为什么吗？因为是传真的，字不清楚。我在“我们的日子”演德瑞克雷莫瑞大夫的时候，他们会送来打印的整个剧本。\nCasting That's great.\n那太棒了。\nAnd, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or something, I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.\n顺便说下，如果你想加长这场戏，像是出车祸之类的，我可以照顾伤患，因为我有出演医务剧的背景。\nCasting Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.\n好吧，感谢你前来试镜。\nNo no, uh, don't thank me for coming in.

Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.\n听听你们俩的话，真是悲哀啊。看来我要一个人去参加女神会议了。\nWell not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.\n想得美，他们会发现杰森·贺利才甩了莫妮卡一个小时，你就跟他上床了。\nThat was only an hour?\n才一小时？\nYou are such a leaf blower!\n你可真是吹落叶机！\nPool drainer!\n池塘排水器。\nTwig snapper.\n嫩枝折断机。\nMonkey butt!\n猴子屁股。\nThat is not in the book!\n这不是书里的话。\nNo!

        <markdown-content>It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.\n是“美好人生”（又译《风云人物》），这个我听说过。\nSo you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.\n所以没问题，片名说明了一切，包你美妙得不得了。\nPlease, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.\n拜托，我已经被《扬基的骄傲》给骗了，（讲述球员卢格里克生病去世的故事）我以为是关于扬基队的骄傲的故事。然后… 那个家伙得了卢格里克症。\nUh, the guy was Lou Gehrig.

It's fun for me.\n不，亲爱的，别担心。我很喜欢跟他们混，很好玩。\nThey're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'\n他们跟我别的朋友不同。他们不会一见面就说，“你知道谁铲雪时死了吗？”。\nAll right that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.\n好吧，那就去吧。加油，尼克队。\nUh, it's the college playoffs.\n是大学篮球决赛。\nOh, then go Vassar.\n加油，瓦萨大学。\nUh, they're not in it.\n他们没在这个联赛里。\nOk, then just go.\n那加油吧。\nOk.\n好。\nOh, why does this bother me so much?

You know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.\n那抱歉，我就是爱想些事情。我是说，工作的时候，一边弄骨头就会一边乱想嘛。\nRoss, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.\n你计划了我们往后二十年生活，我们才在一起六周。\nOh come on, what, you never think about our future?\n你从不想未来的事吗？\nYes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night.\n想，但我想的是，我们明晚住谁那边好…下个礼拜六晚上，我们去哪里吃晚饭。\nI do not think about what our children's names are gonna be. You know what our children's names are gonna be.\n我不会去想，我们的孩子会叫什么名字。你知道我们的孩子会叫什么名字对吧？\nNo, no, I mean, you know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.\n不…我…我是说我看到一本书，里头有个女孩叫艾蜜莉。我觉得…我觉得还不错。\nWhat was the book?\n哪一本书？\nThe big book of childrens' name.\n“儿童命名大全”。\nOk, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. Yeah.\n你听着，我们在一起很棒。对。\nBut I do not wanna have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that.\n但我不要别人为我决定好一切。我那样过一辈子了。\nIt's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left.

You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reed cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.\n喜欢。我不知道，我是该在乔治毁了事业之后…还是在唐娜哭，或是在药剂师害他耳朵流血时会比较快乐。\nAll right, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?\n好吧，我选耳朵流血，你不觉得结局很好吗？\nI didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should've been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."\n结局我根本就没看，我太沮丧了。剧情越来越叫人家失望，这片子应该叫：“人生真烂，就在你觉得无法更烂时，它更烂。”\nKick save and...denied.\n踢球，守住！…接住了。\nBut...he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and...BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?\n但他抢回来，传到中间，然后准备踢，碰…太棒了！那球还可以踢得更漂亮吗？\nMan you are incredible.\n老兄，你真厉害。\nWell, we had a table in college.\n我们大学时也有这玩意儿。\nOh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.\n我不晓得，1800年也有桌上足球。\nNice moustache by the way.

I'm sorry we've been hogging so much of his time.\n听我说，别跟他生气，是我们的错。我们占了他太多时间了。\nYeah, hehehe's just really great to hang out with.\n是呀，跟他真的是很棒。\nWell...\n这个嘛…\nNo no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talking about this. He is so much cooler than our dads.\n不…说真的。我跟钱德刚才还在说，他比我们的爸爸酷多了。\nI mean, you know, our dad's are ok, you know, but Richard is just ow, ow. What are you kicking me for? Huh? I'm trying to talk here.\n我是说我们爸爸是还好啦，可是理查好…你踢我干什么？我正在讲话，你…\nUh, you guys see me as a dad?\n你们觉得我像父辈的？\nOh yeah.\n对呀。\nNo.\n不。\nNooooo.\n不。\nYou're just, you're just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular.

I'll make you feel like one of the guys.\n过来。我会让你觉得，你跟他们一样。\nYou know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.\n对一个很酷的人来说，你的足球烂透了。\nWhat're you talking about, I was killing them.\n我痛宰了他们。\nYeah, well they suck too.\n他们也很烂。\nOk, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.\n对，然后你把有便便的尿布，丢到便便尿布桶里去。\nOk Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.\n叫它们便便尿布，并不会让这个过程更可爱。\nHello.\n你好。\nIt's us.\n是我们。\nCome on up.

What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'\n我不想在电话上跟我爸相认。我该跟他说什么呢？“我是被你抛弃的女儿，对了，我撞伤了你的狗。”\nHey Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.\n菲比，我可以帮你打的。\nOk.

        <markdown-content>So I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth. And since it's Rachel's birthday, and we want to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon. Agh!\n我会准备好蜡烛和我妈的蕾丝桌布。由于是瑞秋的生日，我们要特别一点，我想我会煮一条三文鱼。哦！\nWhat?\n咋啦？\nQuestion. Why do we always set the parties where you poach things?\n我有个问题。为什么每次我们开派对，你都要水煮东西？\nYou want to be in charge of the food committee?\n你想负责食物委员会吗？\nQuestion Two. Why do we always have parties with committees?\n问题二，为什么我们总是开有委员会的派对？\nYeah, really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?\n对啊，说真的。为什么我们不能买些披萨跟啤酒，大家尽兴地吃喝玩乐呢？\nYeah! Yeah, I agree. You know, i think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside. And I'm just not sure we are.\n对啊！就是，我同意。我认为只有你内心很特别派对才会很有趣。而我不觉得我们是这样。\nAlright. You guys don't want it to be special? Fine! You can throw any kind of party you want.\n好吧。你们不想要点特别的？随便啊！你们想办什么样的派对随便你们。\nJoey, they're not real!\n乔伊，它们是假的！\nAh? Ah.\n啊？啊！\nI start miles beneath the surface of these things. Okay? They're fake. See? Honk, honk!\n这里面空空如也。懂没？它们是假的！瞧见没？空~空~如也！\nWow, it's...it's like porno for clowns!\n哇塞！好像……好像给小丑看的色情片哦！\nI talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.\n我跟瑞秋的姐妹说过了，她们都不能来。\nOK. Um...so I still have to invite Dylan and Emma and Shannon Cooper.\n好的。呃……那我还得邀请迪伦和艾玛，还有珊侬·库伯。\nWhoa, whoa, whoa! Um, no Shannon Cooper.\n哇，哇，哇！不要邀请珊侬·库伯。\nWhy not her? Because she um.... she steals stuff.\n为什么？因为她……她会偷东西。\nOr maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.\n又或许她不会偷东西，只是乔伊跟她上床后就没再给她打过电话了。\nJoey, that is horrible.\n乔伊，那太过份了。\nHey, I liked her. Alright? Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know. I...I guess I just got scared.\n嘿，我挺喜欢她的，好吧？或许，或许是太喜欢了。我不知道。我……我想我只是害怕了。\nOh, my god! I'm sorry, I didn't know.\n天啊！对不起，我不知道是这样的。\nI didn't think anyone would buy that. Okay!\n没想到居然会有人相信。好啦！\nHi, honey. How did it go?\n亲爱的，什么情况？\nIt was the graduation from hell.\n地狱般的毕业典礼。\nYou know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.\n知道吗？我表弟靠足球奖学金上的“地狱大学”。\nYou know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduated from college. Nobody thought she would.\n这本该是个快乐的场合。我妹妹从大学毕业了，谁也没料到。\nIt's a true testament to what a girl from Long island will do for a Celica.\n这也真实地说明了，一个长岛女孩为了一部赛利卡跑车（丰田）愿意做什么。\nSo what happened?\n那到底怎么了？\nMy parents happened.\n是我父母啦！\nAll they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly and not talk about the divorce. But noooo!\n他们只需要坐在同一个体育馆里，露出骄傲的笑容，绝口不提离婚的事，但他们做不到！\nThey got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. Agh!\n开幕致词到一半时，他们吵得不可开交。主教甚至得停下来，叫他俩住口。哦！\nYou know what? You know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next eight hours.\n你们知道好消息是什么吗？我接下来得为人倒八小时的咖啡。\nOK. So I guess we don't invite her parents.\n那我想我们还是不要邀请她父母了。\nWell, how about just her mom?\n只邀请她妈妈怎么样？\nWhy her mom?\n为什么是她妈妈？\nBecause I already invited her.\n因为我已经邀请了。\nWoo, woo, did you ask Stacy Roth?\n哦，哦，你邀请史戴西·罗斯了吗？\nAy, can't invite her. She also steals. So does her roommate.\n唉，不能邀她。她也会偷东西。还有她的室友也是。\nOkay! Here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?\n好啦！这是生日蛋糕的蜡烛，生日蛋糕在哪儿呢？\nOkay, we're not having birthday cake. We're having birthday FLAN.\n是这样的，我们不吃生日蛋糕，改吃生日馅饼。\nExcuse me?\n什么？\nIt's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.\n是一种传统墨西哥蛋奶沙司甜点。\nOh, that's nice. Happy birthday, Rachel. Here's some goo!\n哦，很不错哦！生日快乐，瑞秋，来点糨糊吧！\nDr. Green! Oh, my God! It's Rachel's dad. What are you doing here?\n格林医生！老天啊，是瑞秋的爸爸。你来做什么呀？\nWhat? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?\n怎么了？女儿生日，老爸过来看看也不行吗？\nNo, no, the father can. But um...since I am the roommate, I can tell you she's not here. And I'll pass along the message. Okay? So byebye.\n不，不，老爸当然可以。但是……由于我是她室友，我可以告诉你她不在。我会转告她你来过了，好吧？所以，再见了。\nOh! You're having a party! !!\n哦~~~你们要开派对！\nNo, no, not a party.

So. .I'm no stranger to the mustache.\n我吻了，我很专业。我第一个女友是丽萨·迪芭提斯塔，所以我对胡须的感觉并不陌生。\nThen what's the problem?\n那有什么问题？\nSee after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and he says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me, not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.\n我试镜完之后…比提先生过来跟我说“好演技，烂吻技”。你们相信吗？我…我吻技会烂？那就好像…好像是说特丽莎修女（有“妈妈”意思）不是个好妈妈一样。\nWell, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. You know, what's Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.\n好了，谁在乎他怎么想。华伦·比提懂什么叫做接吻？\nHey, what'd your agent say?\n你经纪人怎么说？\nYep, this kiss thing is definitely a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.\n接吻这回事绝对是个问题，比提先生星期一要再看一次。\nMan, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.
