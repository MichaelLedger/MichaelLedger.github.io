Hello, I'm Nick Kelly with the BBC News. Democrats and Republicans in the United States say they've reached an agreement in principle on border security that they hope will avoid a second government shutdown. They hope to turn the agreement into legislation by Wednesday, two days before the current federal funding agreement runs out. Gary O'Donoghue reports. The tentative deal reached between Republicans and Democrats still has to be finalized, but sources close to the negotiations suggest the President may only get around a quarter of the 5.7 billion dollars he was looking for to build more border wall. The big uncertainty is what the President will be prepared to sign. At a rally in el Paso in texas last night, he was giving little away about his attitude to the emerging deal. What there was at the rally was plenty of heated rhetoric about illegal immigrants and crime, and of course, fake news with my BBC cameraman Ron Skins attacked by a Trump supporter as he went about his job filming the speech.\nThe former Vice President of the Spanish region of Catalonia, Oriol Junqueras and eleven other separatists are going on trial later in Madrid over the 2017 Catalan referendum and subsequent declaration of independence. Guy Hedgecoe is in Madrid. This is Spain's most politically sensitive trial for decades. Among the defendants is Oriol Junqueras, former Vice President of Catalonia, who could face up to twenty-five years in prison if found guilty of rebellion. He and several other defendants have been held in custody for months ahead of the trial, prompting claims by their defense teams that this whole judicial process lacks credibility. But the government says the trial, which is expected to last around three months, has all the necessary guarantees.\nPoliticians have been accused of failing to comprehend the dangers posed by multiplying environmental crises. The warning comes from the Institute for Public Policy Research in Britain. Here's Roger Harrabin. The report warns of a potentially deadly combination of factors affecting the planet, including climate change and the mass loss of species, especially insects. The authors note widespread erosion of topsoil, forest felling, acidifying oceans, extrem weather, plastic in the seas, overfishing and more. The report says these factors are driving what they call a complex dynamic process of environmental destabilization. They say this destabilization is occurring at speeds unprecedented in human history. This is the world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼克·凯利，欢迎收听BBC新闻。美国民主党和共和党表示他们已经就边境安全问题达成了一项原则性协议，并希望可以避免下一次政府停摆。他们希望周三前对此进行立法，而两天后现有的联邦资金就将用尽，以下是盖里·奥多诺霍的报道。民主党和共和党之间达成的尝试性协议还有待落实，但是接近该协商的消息人士称特朗普可能只会得到他要求的57亿边境墙资金的四分之一。特朗普将会如何签署这份协议成为了一个很大的不确定因素。在昨晚的埃尔帕索集会中，特朗普并没有透露太多对新协议的看法。集会上充满了关于非法移民、犯罪和假新闻的激进言论，BBC摄影师罗恩·斯金斯在拍摄集会讲话时就遭到了一名特朗普支持者的袭击。\n前西班牙加泰罗尼亚副总统奥利奥尔·容克拉斯以及其余11名分裂主义分子将会在晚些时候在马德里就2017年的加泰罗尼亚公投和以及后续的宣布独立事件接受审判。以下是盖伊·海吉科的报道。这是西班牙几十年来最具政治敏感性的审判。被告奥利奥尔·容克拉斯是加泰罗尼亚前总统，如果反叛罪名成立，他将面临最高25年的监禁。在审判之前，他和几名其他被告已被关押数月之久，他们的辩护团队称整个司法过程缺乏可信度。但是政府表示该审判将会持续约三个月，并且有所有必要的保障。\n研究指出政府人员没能正确理解多重环境危机带来的危害。该警告出自英国公共政策研究院，以下是罗杰·哈里宾的报道。该报告对影响地球的潜在危险因素的合集做出了警告，其中就包括气候变化以及特别是昆虫在内的大量物种灭绝。报告指出的问题包括表层土壤的侵蚀、森林砍伐、海洋酸化、极端天气、海洋的塑料污染、过度捕鱼以及更多问题。他们的报告称这些因素导致了环境不稳定的复杂动态过程。他们表示环境不稳定过程正在以人类历史上最快的速度发展。BBC国际新闻。
