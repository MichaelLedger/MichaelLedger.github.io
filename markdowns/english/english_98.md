Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC news.\nThe Sri Lankan government has blamed a local Islamic group for the suicide bomb attacks on churches and luxury hotels that killed two hundred and ninety people on Sunday. The Sri Lankan president's office says President Maithripala Sirisena will declare a nationwide emergency from midnight on Monday. Sharanjit Leyl has more details about the suspected attackers.\nThis is a small radicalized Islamist group here in Sri Lanka. All seven suicide bombers who were apparently implicated in some of the attacks were all local. But again, the coordinated nature of these attacks taking place in such a short space of time from each other suggest that they did get some international help from a perhaps, an international network. According to that cabinet spokesperson, authorities were aware as soon as April 11 that some sort of coordinated attack would be taking place, but the prime minister's office was not informed.\nThe Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev says Moscow has a chance to improve relations with Ukraine following Volodymyr Zelensky's victory in the presidential election over Petro Poroshenko. However, Mr. Medvedev added he had no illusions about Mr. Zelensky, a comedian with no political experience. Anastasia Gribanova is in Moscow.\nDmitry Medvedev commented on the victory of Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine but did not congratulate him. He said that there is still a chance for Ukraine to improve their relations with Russia. As for Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, he has so far neither commented on the victory or congratulated Volodymyr Zelensky. But many members of Russian parliament have already made their statements. Many of them said that people in Ukraine voted not for Zelensky but against Petro Poroshenko. Many others have sent Mr. Zelensky their congratulations, including the US President, the European Union and the head of NATO.President Trump's special representative said the US would continue to support Ukraine's efforts to restore its territorial integrity and counter Russian aggression.\nIran and Pakistan will set up a joint rapid reaction border force to counter the threat of terrorism. The move was announced by the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at a news conference with the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, who's on a two-day visit to Iran. It's been a series of attacks over the past few months on both sides of the border. Voters will need a second round to decide North Macedonia's next president after an extremely tight race in Sunday's election. Preliminary results show the governing Social Democrats candidate Stevo Pendarovski slightly ahead of his right-wing nationalist rival Gordana Siljanovska.\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是大卫·奥斯汀，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n斯里兰卡政府谴责当地一个伊斯兰组织于周天在教堂和豪华酒店发起自杀式炸弹袭击，袭击导致290人遇害。纳斯里兰卡总统办公室表示，总统迈特里帕拉·西里塞将宣布全国自周一零时起进入紧急状态。以下沙兰杰特·莱尔带来的关于可疑袭击者的更多细节。\n袭击者来自斯里兰卡的一个小规模伊斯兰激进组织，与袭击事件相关的所有七名自杀式炸弹袭击者均为当地人。但这几起袭击发生的时间间隔很短，这一协调特性表明他们确实得到了一些类似国际犯罪网络的帮助。内阁发言人表示，当局在4月11日就知道会发生某种联合袭击，但总理办公室没有得到通知。\n俄罗斯总理德米特里·梅德韦杰夫表示，弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基在总统选举中战胜佩特罗·波洛申科后，莫斯科当局有机会改善与乌克兰的关系。但梅德韦杰夫补充到，他对没有政治经验的喜剧演员泽连斯基不抱任何幻想。以下是阿纳斯塔西娅在莫斯科的报道。\n梅德韦杰夫对弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基在乌克兰的胜利进行了评论，但没有对他表示祝贺。他表示乌克兰仍有机会改善与俄罗斯的关系至于俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京，到目前为止，他既没有对弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基的胜利发表评论也没有对他表示祝贺。许多俄罗斯议会成员已经表述了他们的意见。其中很多人表示乌克兰人民投票不是为了支持泽连斯基而是为了反对佩特罗·波洛申科。还有许多人向泽林斯基先生表示祝贺，包括美国总统、欧盟和北约秘书长。特朗普总统的特别代表表示，美国将继续支持乌克兰恢复领土完整和反对俄罗斯侵犯方面的工作。\n伊朗和巴基斯坦组建了联合快速反应边界部队，以对抗恐怖主义威胁。伊朗总统哈桑·鲁哈尼与巴基斯坦总理伊姆兰·汗在新闻发布会上宣布了此举，后者正在伊朗进行为期两天的访问。在过去几个月内，双方边境发生了一系列袭击事件。周日的选举势均力敌，选民们将需要进行第二轮投票才能决定北马其顿的下一任总统。初步结果显示，执政社会民主党候选人斯特沃·彼得罗夫斯基稍领先于他的右翼民族党竞争对手戈尔达娜·西利亚诺夫斯卡。\nBBC新闻。
