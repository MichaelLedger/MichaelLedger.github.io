Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC news. Israelis are voting in the country's most closely-fought general election in years. The Prime Ministe Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a record fifth term in office. His right-wing Likud party is thought to be facing a strong challenge from a centrist alliance formed by ex-military chief Benny Gantz. Tom Bateman is in Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu has pitched himself as the sole guarantor of Israel's security, but he has been dogged by looming corruption charges and a flare-up with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip saw his credentials under strain. His main challenger Benny Gantz has tried to exploit the bribery claims, pledging more honesty and political unity. The campaign has seen Mr. Netanyahu tacked further right ending with a controversial pledge that Israel would annex Jewish settlements in the occupied west bank.\nMembers of the security forces in Sudan have again attempted to break up a protest outside the army headquarters in the capital Khartoum, which is now in its fourth day. The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of President Omar al-Bashir. Anne Soy reports. Witnesses report hearing heavy gunfire and seeing people running for cover in Khartoum. It is the latest attempt by security forces to disperse thousands who have gathered outside the army headquarters since Saturday. Previous attempts to break up the protests were futile. In some instances, military officers are reported to have protected the protesters. Dramatic video emerged on Monday showing soldiers firing at an unclear target are civilians took cover behind them. The protesters said they were responding to gunfire from the security services.\nDonald Trump has criticized the decision by a federal US judge to ban the practice of sending asylum seekers to Mexico to await their court hearings. On Twitter, the president described the move as unfair to the US, saying the judge had ruled Mexico to be too dangerous for migrants.\nPresidential Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil says he is working with the United States to promote dissent within the Venezuelan military. He told Brazilian radio that the army would decide Venezuela's fate. He said the country could not be allowed to become another Cuba or North Korea.\nThe Turkish electoral commission has rejected a request of the governing AK Party for most of the votes cast in Istanbul's mayoral election to be recounted. It says votes in only fifty-one ballot boxes across the city will be reexamined. It's likely to have little effect on the opposition's estimated 15,000-vote lead.
