Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC news. In the past few minutes, Iran has confirmed that it's broken another condition of the nuclear deal reached with world powers in 2015, but says it doesn't want to abandon the agreement. At a news conference in Tehran, the deputy foreign minister said Tehran had exceeded the level of uranium enrichment set out in the deal. Earlier, the French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani to look at ways of rescuing the agreement, which has been jeopardized by US sanctions. Here's our Middle East analyst Alan Johnston. Those American sanctions are extremely comprehensive and whatever mechanism the European governments might try to fashion, the fact is multinational European companies, if they're given a choice. Do you want to trade with Iran and risk the wrath of the US Treasury, run afoul of those US sanctions laws? Those companies are always gonna choose to deal with America rather than Iraq.\nLeaked emails from the British ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, have described President Trump's administration as inept, insecure, and incompetent. Andy Moore reports. Kim Darroch writes that it's doubtful the Trump administration will ever look competent.

It states Mr. Trump's public claim that he decided against attacking Iran because it would cause one hundred and fifty deaths, just doesn't stand up. The foreign office said the British public would expect their ambassadors to provide an honest, unvarnished assessment of the politics in their countries.\nThe Afghan government says eight members of the security forces have been killed and scores wounded in a bomb blast in Ghazni in the east of the country.

The African Continental Free Trade Area is the product of seventeen years of negotiations.
