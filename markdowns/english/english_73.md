Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC News.\nPresident Putin has responded to a decision by the United States to suspend its participation in a key Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty by saying Russia will do the same. Our response will be a mirror one. Our American partners have announced they're suspending their participation in the treaty, and we are suspending ours, too. They have announced that they are engaged in research and development work, and we will do the same. At a meeting with his foreign and defense ministers, Mr. Putin said Russia would start to develop a new mid-range hypersonic missile. Steve Rosenberg in Moscow has more details. The Kremlin leader said Moscow mustn't and wouldn't get dragged into an expensive arms race. And Russia, he said, would not deploy short-and medium-range weapons in Europe or any other region unless US weapons were deployed there first. He instructed his ministers not to initiate further disarmament talks with Washington, although he made it clear that Russia's proposals on this issue remained on the table. The United States and NATO have accused Moscow of violating the terms of the INF Treaty. Russia has made similar allegations against the United States.\nVenezuela's self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido is attempting to mobilize tens of thousands of his supporters for a day of demonstrations. It's intended to increase pressure on Nicolas Maduro to relinquish the presidency. Orla Guerin in Caracas. However large the protest maybe, the sense here is that it will take a lot more than that to unseat Mr. Maduro. But the opposition believed that a process of change has begun. So far, it seems the president still has the backing of the military leadership, but he is under growing pressure, especially since the US imposed sanctions on the state-owned oil firm this week. That will starve him of revenue and could quickly paralyze the country, which is already stricken by shortages and hyperinflation.\nThousands of yellow vest protesters are congregating in Paris and elsewhere in France in the latest round of demonstrations against the cost of living and the policies of President Emmanuel Macron. This week they are also focusing their anger on the police's use of crowd control guns built as nonlethal that shoot large rubber balls. The projectiles known as flash balls have injured many protesters, resulting in some losing an eye. And that's the latest BBC News.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是大卫·奥斯汀，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n美国决定退出一份冷战期间签订的核武器条约，普京回应称俄罗斯也会采取相同的措施。我们的回应将会与之相同。美方宣布退出协议，我们也会退出。他们宣布正在进行调查与研发工作，我们也会开始相同的工作。普京在与外交部长和国防部长的会议中表示，俄罗斯将会开始研发新的中程超音速导弹，以下是史蒂夫·罗森博格在莫斯科的详细报道。普京表示莫斯科不允许也不会再被带进一场军备竞赛之中。他还表示俄罗斯将不会在欧洲和其他地区部署短程和中程导弹，除非美国率先开始部署。他要求各部长不要与美国进行更进一步的裁军谈判，但他也明确表示俄罗斯关于该问题的提议仍可以进行协商。美国和北约指责莫斯科当局违反了《中导条约》，俄罗斯也向美国提出了相同的指控。\n自称为委内瑞拉临时总统胡安·瓜伊多正企图动员几万名支持者进行一天的抗议活动。此举意在向尼古拉斯·马杜洛施压，让他放弃总统职位。以下是欧蕾·盖林在加拉加斯的报道。不管这场抗议活动会有多大，人们认为这些还不足打败马杜罗。但是反对党认为变革的进程已经开始了。到现在为止，总统仍有军队领导人的支持，但是自从美国本周宣布对委内瑞拉国营石油公司进行制裁之后，马杜罗的压力也越来越大。此举将会断绝马杜罗的财政收入来源并迅速使国家瘫痪，委内瑞拉现已处于着资金短缺和恶性通货膨胀的困境。\n在最后一轮游行活动中，数千名黄马甲组织人员集合在巴黎和法国其他地区，抗议生活成本增加和总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的政策。本周他们将怒火集中在警方对抗议人群使用“人群控制枪”的问题上，这种枪的设计不会致命，只是发射大型的橡胶弹。这种枪弹被称为闪光球，已经使很多抗议人员受伤，导致一些人失去了一只眼睛。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。
