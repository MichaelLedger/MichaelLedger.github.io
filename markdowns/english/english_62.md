Hello, I'm Eileen McHugh with the BBC News. The Constitutional Court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has officially declared the opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi, the winner of last month's presidential election. It rejected an appeal by another opposition candidate Martin Fayulu who's accused Mr. Tshisekedi and the outgoing president of striking a deal. Mr. Fayulu insists he is the only legitimate president of Congo. I call on the whole international community to not recognize a power that has neither legitimacy nor legal quality to represent the Congolese people. Dear compatriots, I launch an urgent appeal to our people so that they take charge and organize peaceful demonstrations across the whole of the national territory in order to defend its sovereignty.\nDemocrats in the US Congress have dismissed a proposal by President Trump on immigration policy, which aims to end the partial shutdown of the US government. Mr. Trump offered what he called a compromise in return for funding his border wall with Mexico, but the Democrats say President Trump is only giving back what he had earlier taken away. From Washington, here's David Willis. Senior Democrats find the very notion of a wall repugnance and believe the president is holding government workers' hostage in a desperate bid to make good on a central promise of his campaign. They declared his new offer a nonstarter and continue to insist that only once the government is reopened will they discuss border security. Where the dispute goes from here is anyone's guess, but White House officials are not ruling out the possibility that the president could walk away from the negotiations and circumvent Congress by declaring a national emergency.\nOne of India's most senior politicians Amit Shah, the president of the governing party BJP has been released from hospital in the capital Delhi after being treated for swine flu. Our South Asia editor Jill McGivering reports. Amit Shah is one of the closest aides of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and seen as a key architect of his campaign to be reelected. So there's been a particular focus on his health when he was treated for swine flu in one of the country's top hospitals. Now he says he's made a full recovery. In recent years, India has seen a series of outbreaks of the virus which is highly contagious and can be fatal. Already this month, almost fifty people have died in Rajasthan and more than a thousand tested positive. Jill McGivering. And that's the latest BBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是艾琳·麦克尤，欢迎收听BBC新闻。刚果民主共和国的宪法法院正式宣布反对党候选人费利克斯·齐塞克迪在上个月的总统大选中胜出。法院拒绝了另一位反对党候选人马丁·法尤卢的上诉申请，他指控齐塞克迪与即将卸任的总统进行了交易。法尤卢表示他才是刚果唯一合法的总统。我呼吁国际社会不要认可该政权，因为它既不合理也不合法，不能代表刚果人民。亲爱的同胞们，我向我们的人民发出了紧急呼吁，希望他们能过行动起来，并在全国范围内组织和平的示威活动来推翻这个政权。\n美国国会的民主党否决了特朗普在移民问题上的提议，该提议旨在解决美国政府部分部门停摆的问题。特朗普称该提议是他做出的一个妥协，以此来为他的墨西哥边境墙计划换取资金。但是民主党称特朗普只是让出了他之前拿走的东西罢了。以下是大卫·威利斯在华盛顿的报道。一名资深民主党人表示边境墙的提议令人厌恶，他认为特朗普通过让政府工人停工来实现他在竞选时做的承诺。他们称特朗普的新提议毫无意义，他们依然表示只有政府重启，才会讨论边境安全问题 。这项争端何时结束谁也不知道，但是白宫官员不排除总统将会退出协商并避开国会来宣布国家进入紧急状态。\n印度最资深的政治家之一，同时也是执政党印度人民党党首的阿玛特·沙阿在首都德里的医院接受猪流感治疗后，现已出院。以下是本台南亚编辑吉尔·麦吉弗林的报道。阿玛特·沙阿是印度首相纳伦德拉·莫迪最亲密的助手之一，并被认为在莫迪连任选举中起了关键的作用。所以，当他在印度顶级医院接受猪流感治疗时，人们对他的健康格外关注。现在，她表示已经完全康复了。在最近几年，印度发生了一系列的猪流感疫情爆发，这种病毒传染性极强，还有可能导致死亡。本月，在拉贾斯坦邦已有55人死于猪流感，还有一千多人被检测出感染病毒。吉尔·麦吉弗林报道。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。
