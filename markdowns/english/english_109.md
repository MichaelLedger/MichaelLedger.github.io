Hello, I'm Chris Barrow with the BBC news.\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman says the attack on his country on Saturday posed a real test of the world's will to confront acts that threaten international stability. Our Middle East analyst Alan Johnston reports.\nThe Saudis are looking to rally the international community behind them in the aftermath of the attack on their oil facilities. The crown prince's remark is part of that effort, presenting what's happened is a challenge demanding a global response. The Saudis say they will soon produce evidence revealing Iran's involvement in the attack. The Iranians deny any responsibility for it. They've warned that if they are attacked, their response wouldn't be limited. They're signaling to the Saudis and their US allies that any possible military exchange would have far reaching consequences.\nSaudi Arabia's new ambassador to Britain has told the BBC that the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is a stain on his whole country. Prince Khalid Bin Bandar Al Saud said an investigation into Mr. Khashoggi's death was continuing. He was killed by Saudi state agents in Istanbul last year, which Riyadh says was a rogue operation.\nThe European Parliament has voted to call for Britain to leave the EU with the deal six weeks before its scheduled departure next month. Here's our Europe correspondent Adam Fleming.
        The European Parliament's call to avoid a no-deal Brexit was endorsed by a large but unsurprising majority of MEPs. Before-hand, they'd heard from the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, he said his meeting with Boris Johnson earlier this week left him with the impression no-deal was a real possibility. Mr. Juncker said he'd prioritize the unity of the EU suggesting he'll continue to support Ireland rather than siding with the UK to get a deal.\nUnofficial results from Israel's second general election in five months indicate that the two main parties are deadlocked. With almost all votes counted, it appears that neither the Likud party of the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor the rival Blue and White Alliance has a clear path to forming a coalition government. From Jerusalem, here's Barbara Plett-Usher.\nThe election has left Israelis confused and uncertain. Racing for fractious coalition talks that will test Benjamin Netanyahu's political instincts. The veteran survivor of Israeli politics has suffered a blow. Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't able to muster the majority to form a government. If the exit polls are right, his Likud party may even have lost seats to the opposition. That leaves him fewer options to defend against possible indictments on corruption charges, but he's nowhere close to admitting defeat.\nAt least twenty-three children have died after a fire broke out at a boarding school in Liberia. More children are missing and afeared to have been killed. The blaze broke out at a boarding house attached to a mosque on the outskirts of the capital Monrovia.\nYou're listening to the latest world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是克里斯·巴洛，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n沙特阿拉伯王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼表示，周六发生在沙特的袭击事件对世界应对威胁国际稳定行为的意愿构成了真正的考验。请听本台中东分析师艾伦·约翰斯顿的报道。\n沙特石油设施遭到袭击后，该国正寻求国际社会的支持。王储的讲话就是为了这一目的。王储称该袭击是一项需要全球作出反应的挑战。沙特称他们将很快拿出证据，证明伊朗参与了此次袭击。伊朗否认对此负有任何责任。他们警告称，如果受到攻击，他们将做出任何必要的反击。他们是在向沙特及其美国盟友发出信号，任何可能的军事行动都将产生深远的影响。\n沙特阿拉伯新任驻英国大使告诉BBC，沙特记者贾马尔·哈苏吉被杀是该国的一大污点。沙特王子哈立德·本·阿尔·萨乌德表示，对哈苏吉之死的调查仍在继续。他去年在伊斯坦布尔被沙特国家特工杀害，利雅得方面称这是一次卑劣的行动。\n欧洲议会投票要求英国在下月按现有协议脱欧，现在距离拟定脱欧时间还有六个星期。以下是本台欧洲记者亚当·弗莱明的报道。\n欧洲议会关于避免无协议脱欧的呼声得到了多数欧洲议员的支持，这并不令人意外。在之前，他们已经收到了来自欧盟委员会主席容克的消息主席表示，本周早些时候与鲍里斯·约翰逊的会面给他留下的印象是，无协议脱欧的可能性真的存在。容克表示，他将优先考虑欧盟的团结，这意味着他将继续支持爱尔兰，而不是支持英国达成协议。\n以色列五个月来第二次大选的非官方结果显示，两大主要政党陷入僵局。现在几乎所有选票都已清点完毕，看来无论是本杰明·内塔尼亚胡总理领导的利库德党，还是蓝白党都无法组建联合政府。以下是芭芭拉·普莱特-厄舍尔在耶路撒冷的报道。\n这次选举让以色列面临疑惑和不确定性。竞争联盟谈判将考验本杰明·内塔尼亚胡的政治直觉。这位以色列政坛的资深幸存者遭受了打击。本杰明·内塔尼亚胡未能召集多数席位组建政府。如果民调结果无误，他的利库德党甚至可能会输给反对党。这让他在面对可能的腐败指控时选择更少，但现在认为他已失败还为时尚早。\n利比里亚一所寄宿学校发生火灾，造成至少23名儿童死亡。还有更多儿童失踪，并有可能已经死亡。大火发生在首都蒙罗维亚郊区一座清真寺附属的公寓。\n您正在收听的是最新的BBC国际新闻。
