This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Eileen McKue. The Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido has outlined his plan to fracture support for President Nicolas Maduro by organizing a huge humanitarian aid distribution operation across Venezuela. Mr. Guaido said he had recruited over six hundred thousand volunteers who would carry the aid from border crossings next Saturday. Food and medicine has been arriving in US military transport planes at the Colombian border town of Cucuta. A representative of Mr. Guaido's interim government Lester Toledo spoke supplies were being unloaded. The most important thing is that the day is close when the doors at the Colombia-Venezuela border will open, so that only meters from here, not only humanitarian aid will go through, not only medical supplies, not only food for our people who don't have any will go through, but also freedom.\nThe acting US Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has said he is not yet determined whether a border wall with Mexico is a military necessity or how much Pentagon money would be used for building it. He said he would start reviewing the initial military planning on Sunday. Mr. Shanahan said the Pentagon had identified the steps needed to take a final call on the subject, but deliberately not made any decisions yet.\nKenya has recalled its ambassador from Mogadishu and reportedly ordered the Somali envoy in Nairobi to return to his country. The neighboring states are engaged in a maritime boundary dispute over an area that's thought to contain lucrative gas and oil reserves. The Kenyan government said the summons was a result of a decision by Somalia to auction off oil and gas blocks in Kenya's maritime territorial area that borders Somalia. The International Court of Justice is hearing a case in the dispute.\nUS Vice President Mike Pence has urged European Leaders to follow Washington's lead and withdraw from what he called the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. In a speech to the Munich Security Council, Mr. Pence said America First did not mean America alone. The time has come for our European partners to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and join us as we bring the economic and diplomatic pressure necessary to give the Iranian people, the region and the world the peace, security, and freedom they deserve.\nVandles in London have painted graffiti on the grave of the German revolutionary philosopher Karl Marx. The second attack on his memorial this month. Slogans like "architect of genocide" were dogged in red paint on the four-metre-high monument. Police say they've made no arrests over the hammer attack earlier this month.
