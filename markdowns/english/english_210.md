It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.\n是“美好人生”（又译《风云人物》），这个我听说过。\nSo you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.\n所以没问题，片名说明了一切，包你美妙得不得了。\nPlease, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.\n拜托，我已经被《扬基的骄傲》给骗了，（讲述球员卢格里克生病去世的故事）我以为是关于扬基队的骄傲的故事。然后… 那个家伙得了卢格里克症。\nUh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?\n那个家伙就叫卢格·里克，你没预感吗？\nPhoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.\n你看就是了，我保证能让你恢复对人类的信心。\nHey, big guy, game time.\n大个儿，球赛时间到了。\nHey, be right there.\n好，马上来。\nThere's a game?\n有球赛？\nUh, yeah, I just got my pickup sticks back from the shop.

It's fun for me.\n不，亲爱的，别担心。我很喜欢跟他们混，很好玩。\nThey're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'\n他们跟我别的朋友不同。他们不会一见面就说，“你知道谁铲雪时死了吗？”。\nAll right that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.\n好吧，那就去吧。加油，尼克队。\nUh, it's the college playoffs.\n是大学篮球决赛。\nOh, then go Vassar.\n加油，瓦萨大学。\nUh, they're not in it.\n他们没在这个联赛里。\nOk, then just go.\n那加油吧。\nOk.\n好。\nOh, why does this bother me so much? I mean II don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.\n我为什么要那么在意呢？我并不想当那种要男友24小时都在一起的人。\nSure.\n对呀。\nIt's just that he doesn't have that much free time, you know, and I don't know, what do I do?\n只是他空闲的时间不多，我不知道，我到底该怎么办？\nDoes it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.\n有关系吗？你始终都会死，或离婚，或枪杀你的宠物。\nAghh. Me too.\n啊。我也是。\nWaitwait a sec, I got a question.

One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.\n不知道，你告诉我吧。我刚刚还像抱足球一样抱着班，接下来我就有两个孩子…住在斯卡斯代尔，抱怨着税太高。\nWell I'm sorry, I think about stuff. You know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.\n那抱歉，我就是爱想些事情。我是说，工作的时候，一边弄骨头就会一边乱想嘛。\nRoss, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.\n你计划了我们往后二十年生活，我们才在一起六周。\nOh come on, what, you never think about our future?\n你从不想未来的事吗？\nYes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night.\n想，但我想的是，我们明晚住谁那边好…下个礼拜六晚上，我们去哪里吃晚饭。\nI do not think about what our children's names are gonna be. You know what our children's names are gonna be.\n我不会去想，我们的孩子会叫什么名字。你知道我们的孩子会叫什么名字对吧？\nNo, no, I mean, you know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.\n不…我…我是说我看到一本书，里头有个女孩叫艾蜜莉。我觉得…我觉得还不错。\nWhat was the book?\n哪一本书？\nThe big book of childrens' name.\n“儿童命名大全”。\nOk, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. Yeah.\n你听着，我们在一起很棒。对。\nBut I do not wanna have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that.\n但我不要别人为我决定好一切。我那样过一辈子了。\nIt's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left.

You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reed cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.\n喜欢。我不知道，我是该在乔治毁了事业之后…还是在唐娜哭，或是在药剂师害他耳朵流血时会比较快乐。\nAll right, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?\n好吧，我选耳朵流血，你不觉得结局很好吗？\nI didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should've been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."\n结局我根本就没看，我太沮丧了。剧情越来越叫人家失望，这片子应该叫：“人生真烂，就在你觉得无法更烂时，它更烂。”\nKick save and...denied.\n踢球，守住！…接住了。\nBut...he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and...BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?\n但他抢回来，传到中间，然后准备踢，碰…太棒了！那球还可以踢得更漂亮吗？\nMan you are incredible.\n老兄，你真厉害。\nWell, we had a table in college.\n我们大学时也有这玩意儿。\nOh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.\n我不晓得，1800年也有桌上足球。\nNice moustache by the way.

He is so much cooler than our dads.\n不…说真的。我跟钱德刚才还在说，他比我们的爸爸酷多了。\nI mean, you know, our dad's are ok, you know, but Richard is just ow, ow. What are you kicking me for? Huh? I'm trying to talk here.\n我是说我们爸爸是还好啦，可是理查好…你踢我干什么？我正在讲话，你…\nUh, you guys see me as a dad?\n你们觉得我像父辈的？\nOh yeah.\n对呀。\nNo.\n不。\nNooooo.\n不。\nYou're just, you're just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular.

I thought I was just one of the guys.\n只是…我只是觉得自己像一百岁的样子，我还以为我跟他们一样。\nCome here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys.\n过来。我会让你觉得，你跟他们一样。\nYou know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.\n对一个很酷的人来说，你的足球烂透了。\nWhat're you talking about, I was killing them.\n我痛宰了他们。\nYeah, well they suck too.\n他们也很烂。\nOk, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.\n对，然后你把有便便的尿布，丢到便便尿布桶里去。\nOk Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.\n叫它们便便尿布，并不会让这个过程更可爱。\nHello.\n你好。\nIt's us.\n是我们。\nCome on up.
