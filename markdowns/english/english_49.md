BBC news. I'm John Shay.\nRussia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov says the country is not willing to consider a prisoner swap involving the former US Marine Paul Whelan. He was arrested in Moscow over a week ago on suspicion of spying. His families say he's innocent. From Moscow, here's Sarah Rainsford. Sergei Ryabkov described the arrest of Paul Whelan as very serious and said that at this stage, talk of swapping him for any Russian detainee was inappropriate, counter-productive and politically unjustified. His comments came after days of speculation that the former US Marine may have been arrested to exchange for Maria Butina who has pleaded guilty in the US to conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of Moscow. Russia's Foreign Ministry and President Putin have condemned that case repeatedly and loudly. Sergei Ryabkov said there is no link between Mr. Whelan's arrest here in Moscow and other detentions.\nA document officially recognizing the independence of Ukraine's Orthodox Church from Russia has been signed at a ceremony at St. George's Cathedral in Istanbul. The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko attended the signing of the document known as "tomos". Jonah Fisher is in Kiev. What the "tomos" does is it recognizes that Ukraine has its own branch of the Christian Orthodox Church, crucially a branch that is separate from the Russian Orthodox Church, because for the last three hundred years or so, the Ukrainian parishes have been under the overall responsibility of the Russian Orthodox Church. That will no longer be the case. This "tomos" has been signed. It now grants official recognition to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. That's why the Russians are so upset and the Ukrainians are so happy.\nOpposition demonstrators in Hungary are due to resume protest shortly against the policies of the far-right government of Viktor Orban. The rallies began last month in response to a controversial law that extends overtime. Nick Thorpe is in Budapest. Today's demonstration is a litmus test to the degree of anger in Hungary against the overtime law, and of the determination of those willing to come out onto the streets. Heavy snow in the past twenty four hours across the country could reduce numbers. They're threatening nationwide strikes unless their four main demands are met. The scrapping of the overtime law, double-digit wage increases, the removal of limitations on the right to strike and a far-reaching pension reform. The Fidesz government has already offered an eight percent wage increase this year, followed by another eight percent next year in an attempt to head off the discontent.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，我是约翰·席亚。\n俄罗斯外交部副部长谢尔盖·里亚布科夫表示俄罗斯不会考虑交换前海军陆战队队员保罗·韦兰。一周前，韦兰因间谍指控被捕。他的家人称他是无辜的。以下是萨拉·雷恩福德在莫斯科的报道。谢尔盖·里亚布科夫表示逮捕保罗·韦兰是非常严肃的，在此节点上讨论用他来交换俄罗斯在押人员是不合适的、起反作用的并且在政治上也是不公正的。在他发表此番言论的前几天，人们猜测逮捕韦兰的目的是交换玛丽亚·布缇娜。她已在美国承认是俄罗斯的一名未注册间谍。俄罗斯外交部和总统普京曾多次强烈地对该案进行谴责。谢尔盖·里亚布科夫表示，逮捕韦兰与其它扣押无关。\n一份官方承认乌克兰东正教会从俄罗斯独立的文件现已在伊斯坦布尔圣乔治大教堂的一个仪式中签署。乌克兰总统佩特罗·波罗申科参加了这份名为“tomos”的文件签署仪式。以下是乔纳·费希尔在基辅的报道。这份“tomos”文件承认了乌克兰有了自己的东正教分支，最重要是独立于俄罗斯东正教的分支。因为在过去的300多年里，乌克兰教区一直都在俄罗斯东正教会的全权负责之下。情况将不再如此，这份“ tomos”文件已签署，它官方承认了乌克兰东正教正教会的合法性。这也是俄罗斯人如此沮丧而乌克兰人如此开心的原因。\n匈牙利的反对派示威人员将不久后重启游行活动，抗议维克托·欧尔班极右翼政府的政策。抗议集会开始于上个月，是为了反对一项有争议的延长加班时间的法律。以下是尼克·索普在布达佩斯的报道。今天的抗议活动将会检验人们对于这项延长加班时间的法律愤怒程度以及人们出门参加游行的决心。在过去的24小时内匈牙利全国范围内下了大雪，这可能会减少游行人群的数量。他们威胁称，如果他们的四项主要要求不能满足，将会发起全国范围内的罢工。这四项要求是取消延长加班时间的法律，两位数的工资增长，取消对于罢工权的限制以及彻底的退休金改革。匈牙利青年民主党政府今年已经为他们提供了8%的工资增长，为了防止民众不满意，明年还会继续增长8%。\nBBC国际新闻。
