**A Father and A Son**\n**父子俩**\nPassing through the Atlanta airport one morning, I caught one of those trains that take travelers from the main terminal to their boarding gates. Free, sterile and impersonal, the trains run back and forth all day long. Not many people consider them fun, but on this Saturday I heard laughter.\n一天早晨去亚特兰大机场，我看见一辆列车载载着旅客从航空集散站抵达登记处。这类免费列车每天单调、无味地往返其间，没人觉得有趣。但这个周六我却听到了笑声。\nAt the front of the first car – looking out the window at the track that lay ahead – were a man and his son.\n在头节车厢的最前面，坐着一个男人和他的儿子。他们正透过窗户观赏着一直往前延伸的铁道。\nThey had just stopped to let off passengers, and the doors wee closing again. “Here we go! Hold on to me tight!” the father said. The boy, about five years old, made sounds of sheer delight.\n他们停下来等候旅客下车，之后，车门关上了。“走吧。拉紧我！”父亲说。儿子大约5岁吧，一路喜不自禁。\nI know we’re supposed to avoid making racial distinctions these days, so I hope no one will mind if I mention that most people on the train were white, dressed for business trips or vacations – and that the father and son were black, dressed in clothes that were just about as inexpensive as you can buy.\n车上坐的多半是衣冠楚楚，或公差或度假的白人，只有这对黑人父子穿着朴素简单。我知道如今我们不该种族歧视，我希望我这样描述没人介意。\n“Look out there!” the father said to his son. “See that pilot? I bet he’s walking to his plane.” The son craned his neck to look.\n“快看！”父亲对儿子说：“看见那位飞行员了吗？我敢肯定是去开飞机的。”儿子伸长脖子看。\nAs I got off, I remembered some thing I’d wanted to buy in the terminal. I was early for my flight, so I decided to go back.\n下了车后我突然想起还得在航空集散站买点东西。离起飞时间还早，于是我决定再乘车回去。\nI did – and just as I was about to reboard the train for my gate, I saw that the man and his son had returned too. I realized then that they hadn’t been heading for a flight, but had just been riding the shuttle.\n正准备上车的时候，我看到那对父子也来了。我意识到他们不是来乘飞机的，而是特意来坐区间列车的。\n"You want to go home now? " The father asked.\n爸爸问：“你想现在回家吗？”\n“I want to ride some more!”\n“我还想再坐一会儿！”\n“More?” the father said, mock-exasperated but clearly pleased. “You’re not tired?”\n“再坐一会儿！”父亲嗔怪模仿着儿子的语调，“你还不累？”\n“This is fun!” his son said.\n“真好玩！”儿子说。\n“All right,” the father replied, and when a door opened we all got on.\n“好吧，”父亲说。车门开了，我们都上了车。\nThere are parents who can afford to send their children to Europe or Disneyland, and the children turn out rotten. There are parents who live in million-dollar houses and give their children cars and swimming pools, yet something goes wrong.\n我们很多父母有能力送孩子去欧洲，去狄斯尼乐园，可孩子还是堕落了。很多父母住豪华别墅，孩子有车有游泳池，可孩子还是学坏了。\n“Where are all these people going, Daddy?” the son asked.\n“爸爸，这些人去哪？”儿子问。\n“All over the world,” came the reply. The other people in the air port wee leaving for distant destinations or arriving at the ends of their journeys. The father and son, though, were just riding this shuttle together, making it exciting, sharing each other’s company.\n“世界各地。”父亲回答。机场来来往往的人流或准备远行，或刚刚归来。这对父子却在乘坐区间列车，享受着父子间的亲情与陪伴。\nHere was a father who cared about spending the day with his son and who had come up with this plan on a Saturday morning.\n而这里。这位父亲却很在意花上一天陪伴儿子，并在这样一个星期六的早上，提出这个计划。\nParents who care enough to spend time, and to pay attention and to try their best. It doesn’t cost a cent, yet it is the most valuable thing in the world.\n父母愿意花时间，愿意关注，愿意尽心尽职。这不要花一分钱，可这却是世间无价之宝。\nThe train picked up speed, and the father pointed something out, and the boy laughed again.\n火车加速了。父亲指着窗外说着什么，儿子直乐.
