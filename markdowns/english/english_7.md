"**The Office - Computer Virus! **\nA: Oh great! This stupid computer froze again!That's the third time today! Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC? It's acting upagain. It must have a virus or something.\nB: Just give me a second; I'll be right up.\nB: I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files!\nA: But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.\nB: Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly; yours wasn't up to date, that's probably what was causing your problems.\nA: Ok. Anything else?\nB: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer!\nA: Um yeah; Sorry about that."
