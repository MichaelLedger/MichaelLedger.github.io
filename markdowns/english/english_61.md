I'm Rosemary Crick with the BBC News. Hello. At least 21 people have been killed and more than seventy injured in a huge explosion at a leaking oil pipeline in central Mexico. Hundreds of people were scrambling to steal some of the fuel when they were engulfed in flames. Electra Nasmyth reports. The blast happened near the Tula refinery in Hidalgo state. Video footage showed a huge fireball and desperate people running away from the flames. One man described having to claw his way through charred bodies as he tried to help. The state oil company Pemex blamed on illegal fuel tap for the fire, a dangerous but highly profitable business which the government says caused Mexico three billion dollars last year. The Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced a major crackdown in December but the controvertial plan has led to feul shortages and long lines at petrol stations in some states.\nThe office of the US Special Counsel Robert Mueller has disputed the accuracy of a news report that President Trump ordered his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed News has said that Mr. Trump instructed Mr. Cohen to lie about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Buzzfeed said it stood by its report. David Willis reports. Another roller coaster week for the president ended with claims that he may have sought to obstruct justice. An impeachable offense if true, but true, it may not be. The White House flatly denied the claim, and later it emerged that the Special Counsel who is investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia didn't buy it either. Buzzfeed's description of specific statements to the Special Council's office are not accurate read a statement. President Trump was clearly ecstatic. Last night, he tweeted "a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country".\nThe partial shutdown of the US government has entered its fifth week with Donald Trump saying he'll make what he described as a major announcement on Saturday. Reports from Washington suggest that senior officials, including the Vice President Mike Pence, have come up with new proposals to resolve the crisis.\nThe government of Burkina Faso has unexpectedly resigned. No explanation was given. But the tiny west African nation has been hit by a wave of Jihadi's attacks and kidnappings of foreigners, including a Canadian geologist who was found dead earlier this week.\nFor the first time, officials in Pakistan have briefed parliament on the country's growing export of human hair. A statement by the Commerce Ministry said Pakistan earned 1.6 million dollars from the sale of hair in the last five years. China, which has an expanding beauty industry, was one of the main buyers taking more than a hundred thousand kilos of hair from Pakistan.
