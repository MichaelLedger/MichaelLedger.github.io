I'm Stuart Mackintosh with the BBC News, hello.\nThe British Prime Minister Theresa May has opened a crucial five-day debate on Brexit by warning Parliament that the choice is between her deal, no deal and no Brexit.\nDon't let anyone here think that there's a better deal to be won by shouting louder. Don't imagine that if we vote this down, a different deal is going to miraculously appear. The alternative is uncertainty and risk. So I promise you today, this is the very best deal for the British people. I ask you to back it in the best interests of our constituents and our country.\nDuring the debate, Mrs. May said the EU had neither the time nor the inclination to reopen negotiations before Britain leaves next March.\nThe US Special Counsel Robert Mueller says Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn should face little or no prison time for giving what he called substantial assistance to the Russian election meddling probe. Mr. Mueller is leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. In court documents filed on Tuesday, Robert Mueller said Mr. Flynn has given first-hand details of contacts between Mr. Trump's transition team and Russian government officials.\nUS stocks have fallen sharply on fears of an economic slowdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day in nearly three months. All of the major US indexes ended the trading day down by more than three percent.\nWe've seen all of the major indexes down more than three percent. You've got bank stocks leading the way, but it wasn't just bank stocks, it was transportation stocks, industrial stocks, Caterpillar, General Electric. A lot of this has to do with concerns or warning signals flashing from the bond market, suggesting that there's perhaps worries about economic growth lying in the future. The likelihood of a recession is much higher and that's why market watchers are paying so much attention to this and getting spooked today.\nThat was Michelle Fleury and markets in Asia also opened sharply lower.\nA group of US Congress members have called on the Rwandan government to drop charges against Diane Rwigara, a government critic who's facing up to 22 years in prison on charges of incitement and fraud. She's due to be sentenced in Rwanda later today. Supporters say the charges are politically motivated and arose from Ms Rwigara's bid to run against President Paul Kagame in last year's elections.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n![](images/TheresaMay.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n我是斯图亚特·麦金托什，欢迎收听BBC新闻，大家好。\n英国首相特蕾莎·梅开启了一场为期五天的重要脱欧辩论，以此警告议会要么接受她的协议，要么无协议脱欧，要么不脱欧。\n不要让在座的人认为通过大喊大叫就能赢得一项更好的协议。不要幻想着否决了这份协议，就会有一份不同的协议奇迹般地出现。替代方案充满了不确定性和风险。所以今天我向你们保证，这是一份对英国民众来说最好的协议。 为了我们的人民和国家的最大利益，我请求你们支持这份协议。\n在辩论中，特蕾莎·梅表示欧盟没有时间也没有意愿在英国明年三月脱欧之前再次开启协商。\n美国特别顾问罗伯特·米勒表示特朗普的前国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林为俄罗斯干预美国大选的调查提供了实质性的帮助，因此他将面临短期刑期或零刑期。米勒正在带头调查俄罗斯干涉美国2016年总统大选一案。在周六的一份法庭文件中，罗伯特·米勒表示弗林提供了关于特朗普过渡团队和俄罗斯政府官员联系的一手资料。\n出于对经济衰退的担忧，美国股市暴跌。道琼斯工业平均指数达到了近三个月以来的最低点。所有的主要美国指数在交易日结束时都下降了3个百分点以上。\n我们看到所有的主要工业指数都下降了超过3个百分点。银行股票首当其冲，但是不仅仅是银行股票，运输业股票、工业股票、卡特彼勒和通用电气的股票都受到了影响。很多都和债券市场传递出的担忧和警告信号有关，这也暗示了人们对于未来经济增长的担忧。出现经济衰退的可能性变得更高，这也是为什么市场观察者今天如此关注该事件并感到惊慌的原因。\n以上是马歇尔·弗勒里的报道。亚洲市场开盘同样大幅下跌。\n美国国会议员呼吁卢旺达政府撤销对政府批判人士黛安·瑞嘉的指控，因煽动和诈骗指控，她将面临22年之久的刑期。今天晚些时候将在卢旺达进行宣判。支持者表示这些指控带有政治动机，且是由于瑞嘉去年与保罗·卡加梅竞选总统引起的。\nBBC国际新闻。
