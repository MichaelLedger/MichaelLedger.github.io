I'm Rosemary Crick with a look at the latest BBC news.\nCarlos Ghosn, the former chairman of the Japanese Carmaker Nissan, has appeared in public for the first time since his arrest in November on suspicion of financial misconduct. He's attended a hearing at the Tokyo District Court. Here is Rupert Wingfield-Hayes.\nMr. Ghosn came in wearing a dark suit without a tie on. He was handcuffed around the waist. He then went on to make a very robust statement in which he categorically denied the allegations against him. He said he had been wrongly accused on meritless and unsubstantiated allegations and he said he had not received any compensation from Nissan Motor Corporation that was not disclosed. So a very direct rebuttal of the allegations and the legal accusations that have been made against him by the prosecutors here.\nThe US National Security Advisor John Bolton is in Turkey for what is expected to be tense talks on the planned withdrawal of American troops from Syria. Last month, Donald Trump promised that all US forces would leave immediately, but on Sunday, Mr. Bolton insisted they stay until the last Islamic State militants were defeated. From Istanbul, Celine Garrett reports.\nDonald Trump first announced the withdrawal of US troops from Syria, after a phone call with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last month. This was a move Ankara had long hoped for. Once US troops pulled out of northern Syria, the Turkish military would be able to cross the border to drive out Kurdish forces, which Turkey sees as terrorists. But with the Kurds turning to Russia for protection, Washington felt obliged to take a step back from Mr. Trump's announcement. His National Security Adviser John Bolton is trying to reassure Kurdish forces that they are still America's allies. That has left Turkey frustrated and it is very difficult to see Ankara agreeing to protect the Kurds. In today's talks, both sides will need to strike a delicate balance as neither wants to damage their relationship.\nThe governor of the US state of Tennessee has granted clemency to a woman who was sentenced to life in prison for murder when she was just sixteen. Cyntoia Brown said she was forced into prostitution and feared for her life when she shot a man dead in Nashville in 2004. She will be freed on parole in August but must remain under supervision for a further ten years.\nPresident of the World Bank Jim Yong Kim is stepping down three years before the end of his term. The bank gave no reason, though it said Mr. Kim would join the private sector and would focus on increasing infrastructure investments in developing countries.\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n我是罗丝玛丽·克里克，欢迎收听最新的BBC新闻\n日本汽车生产商日产的前董事长卡洛斯·戈恩公开露面，这是他自去年11月因涉嫌不当金融行为被捕后的首次露面。他出席了东京地区法院的听审。以下是鲁珀特·温菲尔德-海耶斯的报道。\n戈恩身穿黑色正装走进法院，但是没有打领带。他双手被手铐铐在腰侧。之后他做了强硬的声明，坚决否认了关于他的指控。他表示自己受到了错误的、不道德的且无事实根据的指控，他还坚称没有私拿日产汽车公司的任何报酬。总的来说，他对当地检察官的指控和法律诉讼做了直接的反驳。\n美国国家安全顾问约翰·博尔顿正在土耳其就美国拟从叙利亚撤军问题进行的紧张会谈。上个月，唐纳德·特朗普总统承诺所有美国军队将立即撤军，但是周日，博尔顿坚称在彻底打败伊斯兰国组织之前不会撤军。以下是赛琳·盖瑞特在伊斯坦布尔的报道。\n唐纳德·特朗普在上个月与土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安通话后首次宣布从叙利亚撤军。这也是土耳其一直以来希望的结果。一旦美国从叙利亚北部撤军，土耳其军队将可以穿越边境驱逐被他们视为恐怖分子的库尔德武装。但随着库尔德武装转而向俄罗斯寻求帮助，美国认为不得不暂缓实施特朗普的决定。特朗普的国家安全顾问约翰·博尔顿正试图向库尔德武装保证他们仍是美国的盟友。而这也让土耳其受挫，而且土耳其同意保护库尔德的可能性很小。在今天的谈判中，由于双方都不想损害彼此间的关系，他们将需要取得一个微妙的平衡。\n美国田纳西州的州长给予了一名女犯人宽大处理，该女性在16岁时因杀人被判终身监禁。辛托妮亚·布朗表示，2004年在纳什维尔，当时的她被迫卖淫且担心自己的生命安全因而开枪打死一人。她将在8月份被保释，但是在接下来的10年内将必须受到监控。\n世界银行行长金墉将提前三年卸任。世界银行并没有给出具体原因，虽然该行表示金墉将会进入私营领域并将关注增加对发展中国家基础设施投资的问题。\nBBC新闻
