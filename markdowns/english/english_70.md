BBC News. Hello, I'm Gareth Barlow.\nThe Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described as criminal sanctions imposed on the state owned oil company PDVSA by the United States. He accused Washington of setting out to steal the firm's US space of subsidiary Citgo and said PDVSA would take legal action to protect its asset. The sanctions were announced by the US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington earlier. From where Barbara Plett-Usher reports.\nThis is a critical economic move because Venezuela's oil sales to the United States are a big source of cash revenue for the Maduro government. The sanctions bar Americans from doing business with the state oil company and freeze any assets it has in the US. This is also an attempt to boost Mr. Maduro's rival, the opposition leader Juan Guaido. The Trump administration recognized him last week as Venezuela's leader. The aim is to transfer the oil money to him and the country's national assembly. As the announcement was made, Mr. Guaido said he was taking control of Venezuela's assets abroad to prevent Mr. Maduro from seizing them if he left power.\nProtesters have gathered outside the offices of the Brazilian mining company Vale as rescuers continue a desperate search for survivors from Friday's dam collapse.
