Hello, I'm Eileen McKue with the BBC News.\nAt least twenty-three people have been killed in Alabama after tornadoes hit the US state. Jay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County on the border with Georgia, said the number could rise as the authority searched through the rubble and debris. The victims include a number of children. Alabama governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency. Chip Brownlee is a local journalist in Auburn, in Lee County.\nIt came up just so fast. You know, I think, you know, people don't have time to get out of the way of these things, especially when they're moving as fast as they were moving today. And when this one was particularly as powerful as it was, there's not much you can do, particularly when these things are leveling homes like this one did, snap trees in half. It's flipping cars.President Trump has urged people in the region to stay safe.\nVenezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido says he's returning to his country after a week-long tour of South America to amass support for his attempt to remove President Nicolas Maduro from power. Speaking on social media from an undisclosed location, Mr. Guaido said he would lead anti-government marches throughout Venezuela on Monday and Tuesday. This report from Will Grant.\nWe'll see each other tomorrow, Juan Guaido told his supporters in a late night address on Sunday via Facebook live. It was a reference to a march he's called for in Caracas, although it isn't yet clear if he will actually be back in the country by then or how he intends to return. He was placed under a travel ban by the Supreme Court loyal to President Maduro. Now his intention is to come back to Venezuela, which may provoke the Maduro government into arresting him. If they do, he said it would be one of their last mistakes in office.\nThe United States will on Monday merge the activities of its consulate in Israel with those of its embassy in a move that's angered Palestinians. The consulate in Jerusalem has until now operated as a semi-independent diplomatic mission serving Palestinians in the disputed city and acting as a direct channel of communication between Washington and the Palestinian authority. The merger will make the consulate subordinate to the US ambassador to Israel David Freeman, considered a supporter of the Israeli settlement program in the West Bank.\nPolice in Kenya say a helicopter has crashed in the northwest of the country, killing all four American passengers on board and their pilot. Reports say the helicopter came down after taking off from a tourist camp on a remote island in Lake Turkana on Sunday evening. The cause is not yet known. That's the BBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是艾琳·麦克尤，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n龙卷风登陆后已致美国阿拉巴马州至少23人死亡。李县与乔治亚州接壤，该县警长杰·琼斯表示随着当局在废墟中搜查的深入，死亡人数还会上升。遇难者中包括很多儿童。阿拉巴马州长凯·伊维宣布该州进入紧急状态。以下是欧本市当地记者奇普·布朗里在该县的报道。\n龙卷风来势迅猛，人们都没有时间来躲避，特别是像今天的风势异常猛烈。在这样强烈的风势下，人们能做的不多。尤其是像这种风力大到可以夷平房屋，刮断树木，甚至将汽车吹到空中。特朗普要求该地人们待在安全的地方。\n委内瑞拉反对党领导人胡安·瓜伊多表示在经过一周南美之行后，将会回国寻求支持助他推翻尼古拉斯·马杜罗政府。瓜伊多在未知地点通过社交媒体表示，他将会于周一和周二在委内瑞拉领导反政府游行。以下是威尔·格兰特的报道。\n胡安·瓜伊多在周日晚间的Facebook直播中告诉他的支持者，明天将会与他们见面。这指的是他号召在首都加拉加斯举行一次游行活动，但是目前尚不清楚他到时候是否会真的回国，他回国的方法也不可知。忠于马杜罗总统的最高法院对他实施了旅行禁令。现在，他返回委内瑞拉的企图可能会激怒马杜罗政府逮捕他。他表示，如果他们逮捕了他，这将是执政政府最后的错误之一。\n美国将于周一合并以色列总领事馆和大使馆，此举激怒了巴勒斯坦人。耶路撒冷总领事馆直到现在都是一个半独立的外交机构，在这个颇具争议的城市中为巴勒斯坦人提供服务，也是华盛顿和巴勒斯坦当局直接沟通的渠道。 此次合并将会让总领事馆从属于美国驻以色列大使大卫·弗里曼，他被认为是西岸以色列定居点计划的支持者。\n肯尼亚警方称一架直升机在该国西北部坠毁，机上四名美国乘客和飞行员全部遇难。报道称这架直升机于周日晚间从图尔卡纳湖的一个偏远小岛上的游客营地起飞，之后坠毁。目前事故原因还不清楚。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。
