Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?\n真好笑，但你们也该有所长进，别再闹了。况且瑞秋在和她爸交往，而他比她大多了，看来不只是我对化石有兴趣。\nRachel: I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.\n这话只会提醒我们，你对化石有兴趣。\nRoss: Ok, ok. Uh, well uh, Rachel is gonna need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.\n好吧，瑞秋想和他甜言蜜语必须很大声说，否则他听不清。\nChandler: Ross.\n罗斯。\nRoss: Oh, come on, you guys, that's funny!
