Hello, I'm Eileen Mckue with the BBC News.\nUS-backed forces are continuing an all-out offensive to defeat hundreds of Islamic State fighters from their last hold out in northeastern Syria. IS militants are reported to be putting up fierce resistance. Sebastian Usher reports.\nAir strikes by the US-led coalition and artillery fire have pummeled the IS position which measures about four square kilometres. The SDF, a Kurdish-led alliance believes it will shortly achieve a decisive victory. There may still be up to six hundred IS fighters in the area. Thousands of civilians have escaped but others are believed to remain. IS does still hold another scrap of territory in Syria and it continues to carry out dozens of attacks. Even if it loses every last fragment of its once-vaunted and self-declared caliphate, the group still poses a potent threat in both Syria and Iraq.\nTrade and conflict will dominate discussions at the African Union Summit, which is getting underway in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Particular emphasis is being placed on the more than twenty million people who have been forced to flee their homes because of wars. Emmanuel Igunza reports from the meeting.\nThe UN Refugee Agency says Africa holds more than a quarter of the world's refugees and internal displace, a total of more than twenty million people. The leaders will also discuss efforts to integrate the continent's trade policies, following the signing last year of an European Union style free market agreement. The African Union has embarked on a series of reforms to streamline its operations and make it less dependent on international financial support. It hopes the changes can also help the AU shed its image of a body that has plans and ambitions but achieves little.\nIndia says more than 1700 people have died in various incidents of human-elephant conflict in the past three years. In the same period, the Ministry of Environment says 373 elephants lost their lives due to electrocution and poaching. This report from Anbrathan Antirajon.\nWildlife expert say deforestation and expanding human settlements along space of forest used by elephants known as elephant corridors as the reasons for the high number of deaths of both humans and the animals. Farmers trying to chase away marauding elephants using firecrackers, drums and fire bombs have become a regular occurrence, particularly in states like Assam, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Desperate farmers often put up illegal electric fences to stop the animals from destroying the crops leading to elephant deaths. India is home to the largest population of Asian elephants in the world and estimated twenty-seven thousand animals.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是艾琳·麦克尤，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n美国支持的军事力量将对叙利亚北部数百名伊斯兰国战士所坚守的最后领域发起全面进攻。据报道，伊斯兰国激进分子将进行激烈的抵抗。以下是塞巴斯蒂安·厄什尔的报道。\n美国领导的联盟已对伊斯兰国组织约四平方公里的驻地进行了空袭和炮击。库尔德领导的联盟，叙利亚民主力量（SDF）认为他们很快便将取得决定性的胜利。该区域内可能还有多达600名伊斯兰国战士。数千名平民已经逃离该区，但据信仍有人留在那里。伊斯兰国组织在叙利亚还有一块驻地，他们还继续了发起了数十次袭击。即使失去了最后一片自称的伊斯兰领土，该组织仍是叙利亚和伊拉克境内一个潜在的威胁。\n贸易和冲突仍将是非洲联盟峰会的主要议题，峰会正在埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴进行。峰会将特别关注两千多万因战事而被迫逃离家乡的难民。以下是埃马纽埃尔·伊谷文泽的报道。\n联合国难民署表示非洲有世界四分之一的难民以及国内的无家可归者，总数超过了两千万。领导人们还将讨论整合非洲大陆贸易政策的措施，他们在去年也签署了一份欧盟式自由市场协议。非盟现已开启了一系列改革措施来提高工作效率，并减少其对国际金融援助的依赖。他们希望这些改革能够帮助非盟摆脱“有计划有抱负，但是很少能实现”的形象。\n印度表示在过去的三年里有1700多人死于各种人象冲突。印度环境部表示，同期有373头大象死于触电和偷猎。以下是安德布里森·安迪罗杰的报道。\n野生动物专家表示，森林砍伐和人类居住地扩张侵占了有“大象走廊”之称的森林这是导致人类和动物大量死亡的原因。农民用鞭炮、锣鼓和燃烧弹驱赶破坏庄稼的大象已成为常态，特别是在阿萨姆邦，西孟加拉邦和泰米尔纳德邦等州。绝望的农民通常是架起非法电围栏来防止大象破坏他们的庄稼，这也导致了大象死亡。印度是世界上拥有亚洲象最多的国家，据估计有27,000头。\nBBC国际新闻。
