Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News. The French government is abandoning plans to increase fuel taxes that prompted weeks of sometimes violent demonstrations. Four people died and hundreds were injured. After suspending the measure temporarily earlier this week, the Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has announced that it'll be dropped altogether from legislation on next year's budget. He said the government had to maintain peace. If the state is to remain strong and firm, it is first of all, the guarantor of public peace. To set the course and hold it is necessary in order to govern France. And as I said yesterday, no tax is worth putting the unity of the nation in danger.\nSerbia says it's considering military intervention as a possible response if its former province of Kosovo goes ahead with a plan to create its own army. President Aleksandar Vucic said the proposal was aimed at driving out Serbs still living in Kosovo.\nThe Liberian state energy company says about sixty percent of all electricity generated in the country is stolen. The theft is causing estimated losses of about thirty five million dollars a year as Warren Bull now reports. The Liberia energy corporation says large numbers of people are making illegal connections to their homes and businesses. Speaking to state radio, a spokesman said the theft was diverting cash that would have been used to improve power supplies to the west African country. Liberia is trying to rebuild an energy sector destroyed during a civil war which lasted from 1989 to 2003. The United States is giving financial and technical aid to increase connectivity as part of the Power Africa Initiative launched by the former US President Barrack Obama.\nBut the country still has one of the lowest access rates to energy in the world, only one in eight Liberians have electricity. There have been warm tributes to the former US President George H. W. Bush at his state funeral in the National Cathedral in Washington. Gary O'Donoghue was following the ceremony. With full pomp and ceremony, America paid tribute to its 41st President, a man who spent a lifetime in public service. George W. Bush, eldest son and 43rd President delivered the warmest of eulogies. But in America he leaves behind a country much changed since he controlled the levers of power, a country divided in ways that would have been anathema to his brand of politics. This is the latest world news from the BBC.\n![](images/bush-funeral.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼尔·努内斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。法国政府将放弃上涨燃油税的计划，该计划也激起了数周暴力时发的游行活动。已有四人死亡，数百人受伤。本周初该计划暂时中止之后，总理爱德华·菲利浦宣布上涨燃油税将从明年的预算法案中移除。他表示政府需要保持和平状态。如果法国要保持强大和稳固的话，首先它要保证治安。在治理法国方面，制定方向和稳固这一方向是必要的。正如我昨天所说的，没有一项税法可以不顾国家的统一。\n塞尔维亚称或考虑武力介入，如果原省份科索沃实施创建军队的计划。总统亚历山大·武契奇表示他们的计划是驱逐仍生活在科索沃的塞尔维亚人。\n利比里亚国家能源公司表示大约60%的国家电力被盗。偷电行为造成了大约每年3500万美元的损失，以下是沃伦·布尔的报道。利比里亚能源公司表示大量民众正在为其家庭和企业非法连接电网。一名发言人对国家广播说，偷电行为所转化的钱本应该用于为这个西非国家改善电力供应。利比里亚正在重建毁于1989年到2003年内战期间的电力部门。美国正在为利比里亚提升电网连接提供财力和技术支持，这也是由美国前总统巴拉克·奥巴马发起的非洲电力计划的一部分。\n但是该国仍然是世界上电网连通率最低的国家之一，只有八分之一的利比里亚人通上了电。美国前总统老布什的国葬在华盛顿的国家大教堂举行，人们向他表达了真挚的悼念。盖里·奥德诺霍正在对葬礼进行报道。在隆重的葬礼上，美国民众向第41任总统致以敬意，他将一生的时间都用在了公共事业上。他的大儿子，美国第43任总统小布什发表了最温暖的悼词。自从他掌控权利杠杆以来，他离开后的美国发生了很大变化，国家的分裂现状也正是他的执政理念所深恶痛绝的。BBC国际新闻。
