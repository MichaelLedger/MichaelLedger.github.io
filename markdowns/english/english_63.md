Hello, I'm Eileen McKue with the BBC News.\nSouth Africa has disclosed that it turned down a request from Zimbabwe for an emergency loan of 1.2 billion dollars in December. Soon after the request was rejected, the Zimbabwean government was forced to announce a steep increase in the price of fuel, sparking angry protest. Perm Zufanany reports from Johannesburg.\nAsked whether loan was turned down, Treasury spokesperson Jabulani Sikhakhane told the BBC Zimbabwe is in a dire financial situation, but South Africa does not have that kind of money. It is believed that Zimbabwe had hoped to use the cash injection to stabilize the ailing economy and resolve fuel shortages in the country. President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced a drastic fuel hike last week, leading to widespread and violent protest which saw at least 12 people killed in clashes with security forces.\nIsrael has announced that it struck a number of sites inside Syria as part of its increasingly open effort to dislodge Iranian forces there. The Russian Defense Ministry says four Syrian soldiers were killed, but monitors based in Britain say eleven people died in the attack. Israel said it was responding to Iranian rocket fire which intercepted on Sunday.\nEuropean Foreign Ministers are expected to impose sanctions today on two Russian military intelligence officers blamed by the West for a nerve agent attack in the British city of Salisbury last year. They're among nine people facing new EU penalties for using chemical weapons in breach of international treaties.\nEU Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels have said it's up to Britain to decide what it wants to do next about Brexit, as the British Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to address parliament again. The Spanish Foreign Minister said she needed to come up with something substantially different to secure the backing of the British parliament. But our correspondent Rob Watson says Mrs. May's plan appears not to have deviated.\nI think people would say rather cynically that her hope is what it has been all along, but essentially those on the hard right of the Conservative Party enthusiastic about Brexit will be incredibly frightened about all this talk of efforts to stop Brexit or put a delay on it or have some other option and that those who are on the remain side of the Conservative Party will be utterly terrified at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit all together. So I think in many ways her plan hasn't changed very much and I don't think her tactics have changed very much. Now whether they'll work is an entirely different matter. Rob Watson reporting.\nThat's the latest BBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是艾琳·麦克尤，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n南非披露称在12月拒绝了津巴布韦12亿美元的紧急贷款请求。请求遭拒后，津巴布韦政府被迫宣布大幅度上调燃油价格，这也导致了愤怒的抗议活动。以下是本·兰尼在约翰内斯堡的报道。\n当被问及贷款是否被拒后，财政部发言人亚布拉尼·斯卡哈尼告诉BBC称津巴布韦财政状况十分严峻，但是南非并没有那么多钱可供贷款。据称，津巴布韦曾希望用注入资金的方式来稳定国内病态的经济，解决国内的燃油短缺问题。上周埃默森·姆南加古瓦总统宣布大幅上调燃油价格，导致了大范围的暴力抗议活动，至少有12人在与安全部队的冲突中死亡。\n以色列宣布他们打击了叙利亚境内的多个目标地点，这是他们加大力度驱逐当地的伊朗武装计划的一部分。俄罗斯国防部表示有四名叙利亚士兵死亡，而驻英国的观察机构则表示有11人在袭击中丧生。以色列表示伊朗周日对其进行了火箭弹袭击，但被拦截，而这是对该袭击的反击。\n欧洲国家外交部长将于今天对两名俄罗斯军事情报人员实施制裁，西方国家指控他们去年用神经毒素袭击了英国城市索尔兹伯里。因违反国际条约使用化学武器，包括他们在内的9名人员将面临新的欧盟处罚。\n在布鲁塞尔会面的欧盟各国外交部长称接下来脱欧如何进行将由英国决定，英国首相特蕾莎·梅准备再次向国会发表讲话。西班牙外交部长表示她需要想出一个有本质上区别的方案来确保得到英国议会的支持。但我台记者罗勃·华生表示梅的计划似乎没有改变。\n我认为人们一都对特蕾莎·梅的希望持以讽刺，但本质上那些对脱欧保持乐观的保守党极右翼分子将非常害怕脱欧计划停止，或是被推迟，抑或是出现别的选择，保守党中剩下的一部分人将会非常害怕无协议脱欧的出现。所以，我认为她的计划在很多方面来说都没有太多的改变，并且我认为她的战略也没有太大的变动。现在，这些能否起作用都是另一回事了。罗勃·华生报道。\n以上就是最新的BBC新闻。
