Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC News. Iran's Foreign Ministry has praised the military for shooting down an American drone on Thursday, warning that no violation of the country's territorial integrity would be allowed. A spokesman said Iran would counter all aggression against it regardless of any decision by Washington. Alan Johnston reports. The US called off a planned attack on Iran on Thursday night, but tensions remain extraordinarily high and the war of words goes on. In Tehran, a Foreign Ministry spokesman praised the forces that downed the American drone and warned again that any threat to Iran would be counted. In Washington, President Trump has said that if it comes to a war, Iran would be obliterated, but he knows that all-out conflict of that kind would be fraught with the most enormous risk. It could very quickly spill out beyond Iran's borders and engulf the Middle East.\nThe German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer says right-wing extremism has become as dangerous as Islamist violence. Mr. Seehofer said the murder of a local politician in the city of Kassel by suspected far-right fanatic earlier this month had motivated him to do everything possible to increase security. Here's our Europe regional editor Mike Saunders. Horst Seehofer's political hallmark is to talk tough. First, It was illegal migration. Now It's right-wing extremism. In a newspaper interview, he said insults, slander and incitement should be prosecuted whether online or elsewhere. He said he'd look at restricting the basic rights of culprits. It's an indication of how badly the country has been shaken by the murder of Walter Lubcke, a senior Conservative, shot in the head at point-blank range at his home in central Germany this month. A forty-five-year-old suspect is in custody.\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has urged the Venezuelan government to release all political prisoners. She said she'd received permission to establish a permanent human rights office in Caracas. Mr. Maduro has promised to listen to her recommendations. People in Mauritania are voting to choose a successor to President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. He's stepping down after completing two terms in office since seizing power in a coup eleven years ago. The election marks the first time an elected leader in Mauritania has handed power to an elected successor since independence nearly sixty years ago.\nOfficials in Hawaii say all nine people on board a sky diving aircraft died when it crashed on the island of Oahu. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said the twin engine aircraft went down near Dillingham Airfield. The plane was engulfed in flames shortly after takeoff. An investigation has been ordered to determine the cause of the accident. Those are the latest stories from BBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是大卫·奥斯汀，欢迎收听BBC新闻。伊朗外交部称赞军方周四击落一架美国无人机，并警告不要侵犯伊朗的领土完整。一位发言人表示，无论华盛顿做出什么决定，伊朗都会反对一切侵略活动。 以下是艾伦·约翰斯顿的报道。星期四晚上，美国取消了对伊朗的袭击计划，但局势依然非常紧张，双方的论战仍在继续。在德黑兰，一名外交部发言人称赞伊朗部队击落美国无人机，并再次警告说，任何对伊朗的威胁都将被追究。在华盛顿，特朗普总统曾表示，如果事态发展到战争的地步，伊朗将被消灭，但他知道所有这种全面的冲突将带来最大的风险。这种危险将很快就会冲出伊朗的边界继而吞没中东地区。\n德国内政部长霍斯特·西霍弗说，右翼极端主义已经变得像伊斯兰主义暴力活动一样危险。西霍弗表示，本月早些时候一名极右翼狂热分子涉嫌谋杀了卡塞尔市的一名当地政客，这促使他尽一切可能增加安全措施。以下是我台的欧洲区域编辑迈克·桑德斯的报道。霍斯特·西霍弗的政治特点是态度强硬。他首先处理的是非法移民，现在又到了右翼极端主义问题。在一次报纸采访中，他表示在网上或其他地方的侮辱、诽谤和煽动行为都应被起诉。他表示会考虑限制罪犯的基本权利。该迹象也表明德国被一名资深保守党人沃尔特·鲁布克的谋杀案的震惊程度有多大，他本月在德国中部的家中被近距离枪杀。一名四十五岁的嫌犯已被拘留。\n联合国人权事务高级专员米歇尔·巴切莱特敦促委内瑞拉政府释放所有政治犯。她表示已经获准在加拉加斯建立一个永久性人权办公室。马杜罗已承诺将听取她的建议。毛里塔尼亚人民将投票决定选举穆罕默德·乌尔德·阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹总统的继任者。他在十一年前的政变中夺取政权，现在他已完成两个任期，正准备下台。这次选举标志着毛里塔尼亚自六十年前独立以来，首次民选领导人将权力移交给另一位民选领导人。\n夏威夷的官员说，一架跳伞飞机在奥阿胡岛坠毁，机上九名乘客遇难。夏威夷交通局表示，这架双引擎飞机在迪林厄姆机场附近坠毁。这架飞机在起飞后不久坠毁，之后被火焰吞没。 当地政府已经下令调查事故原因。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。
