Joey: Ok, pick a card.\n好了，选一张卡。\nChandler: Ok.\n好。\nJoey: All right now, memorize it. You got it?\n记住花色号码。好了没？\nChandler:Oh, yes.\n好了。\nJoey: Ok. Is that your card?\n是这张吗？\nChandler: Yes.\n就是这张。\nCarol: Hey guys!\n大家好！\nAll: Hi there!\n嗨！\nCarol: Guess what? Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial!\n你们猜怎么着？班要上电视拍广告了！\nPhoebe: What're you talking about? !\n你们在说什么？\nRoss: Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute...\n虽然还不确定，不过我们在公园里遇到一个人，他觉得班很可爱……\nRoss: You know, which he is- umm anyway, we uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.\n这也是事实啦。所以那个人留了张名片，要我带班去参加广告试镜。\nJoey: Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition? !\n这个人是本地最大的选角导演。班去公园随便散个步，就有试镜自动送上门！\nJoey: I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times, no one ever offered me an audition.\n我是说，班，真有你的！那个公园我都去了几百万次了，从来没人主动找我去试镜。\nRoss: I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...\n我知道，真的很神奇！我们只是在陪班玩荡秋千……\nJoey: I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong? !\n我每次都在玩荡秋千啊！我是哪里做错了？\nChandler: That.\n荡秋千。\nRachel: Ok, gotta go! Wish me luck! Ross & Joey: Good Luck!\n我要出门了，祝我好运！好运！\nChandler: Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?\n瑞秋，既然你在罗夫·罗兰工作，能不能带几件衬衫回来？\nRachel: Uh, well, you know what? I don't know if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...\n第一天上班就偷公司东西，我可能下不了手喔。\nChandler: Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.\n不愿意从公司偷窃，有意思。\nMonica: Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.\n就算有人能拿免费的，那也非我莫属。\nRachel: Ok guys, way to wish me luck!\n好了，各位，祝我好运吧！\nAll: Good luck! Go get 'em!\n祝你好运，给他们好看！\nPhoebe: Ok, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.\n好，来讨论帮瑞秋庆生的事。我建议在周末办惊喜派对。\nJoey: Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.\n可是一个月后才是她生日啊。\nPhoebe: Ok but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.\n是没错，但在生日当天开派对，那就不惊喜啦。\nMonica: I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we-we can have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.\n我觉得这主意不错。我们办个晚餐派对，邀请好朋友过来。\nJoey: Ross! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!\n罗斯！我们要帮瑞秋办惊喜派对。\nRoss: Ok!\n好！\nJoey: Done.\n搞定。\nPhoebe: Ok, great, so do you wanna do it together?\n好，那你要一起来吗？\nMonica: I would love to do it together!\n乐意之至。\nJoey: They're gonna do it together.\n她们要一起来耶。\nChandler: Dude! That's my girlfriend!\n兄弟，那位可是我女友！\nJoey: What, so I gotta shut it down now?\n所以我就得闭嘴？\nRoss: All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben and then we're off to the big audition.\n好，我得走了，我要接班去参加大试镜。\nMonica: It's gonna be weird seeing some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.\n看到有演员假装是班的父亲，那种感觉一定很怪。\nRoss: Yeah.\n是啊。\nChandler: Weirder than seeing his two moms make out?\n比看班的两个妈妈亲热还要怪吗？\nJoey: Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?\n爸爸？广告里面有爸爸？\nRoss: Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.\n是啊，班和爸爸喝汤，演得很陶醉的样子。\nJoey: Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with you and see if I can get an audition as the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.\n或许我可以跟你们一起去，搞不好能试镜演那个爸爸。说到扮演班的爸爸，由我这教父上场更最适合了。\nRoss: You're not his godfather.\n你不是班的教父。\nJoey: What? ! Are you kidding? !\n什么？你在开玩笑吧？\nRoss: Of course I am! Ok, let's go, godfather.\n当然是啊！我们走吧，教父。\nJoey: All right!\n好耶。\nJoey: Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!\n他们允许我试镜了！\nRoss: Really? That's great!\n真的？太棒了！\nJoey: I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her. Hey, and the other one I know from...well you know.\n我知道……有个女的看过我演舞台剧，所以我离得她远远的。另一个我也认识，原因你也知道……\nCarol: Hey, that kid looks familiar.\n那个孩子看起来很眼熟。\nJoey: Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company.\n是啊，他拍过一堆广告。糖果广告、PS游戏机，还帮电话公司拍过广告。\nJoey: In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was maaaad...\n他演得实在是太好了，说服我换了电话公司。钱德因此还气得半死……\nRoss: Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. All right? Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him,look at you.\n不过他这次休想拿到这角色，因为班比他可爱多了。看就知道，宝贝，看看你。\nJoey: That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?\n很好，如果我能演班的爸爸，这样是不是很棒？\nRoss: Joey, you look nothing like Ben.\n乔伊，你跟班一点都不像。\nJoey: I look more like him than you do!\n比你像多了！\nCarol: You know, I really don't know you well enough for you to do that.\n我跟你还没有熟到生小孩的地步。\nKim: So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?\n现在是最后的二选一。南茜，我知道你喜欢这一个，我也有同感。瑞秋，你觉得呢？\nRachel: Well, umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.\n那个是很漂亮，但我喜欢这个的面料，抱歉了。\nKim: Oh, don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions. And then I take credit for them- I'm kidding.\n不用抱歉，提供意见是你的职责之一。功劳归我，开玩笑的。\nNancy: She is kidding, but, don't ever disagree with her again. Ok, now I'm kidding!\n她这次是在开玩笑，但下次可别跟她意见相左。这次换我在开玩笑！\nRachel: Oh, what a fun office.\n这个办公室真有趣。\nKim: I don't know which one, but I do know, I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?\n我不知道要选哪一个，不过先来根烟倒是真的。不如我们出去休息一下，等回来之后再解决？\nKim: Rachel?\n瑞秋？\nRachel: Yeah.\n恩。\nKim: You smoke?\n你抽烟吗？\nRachel: Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories...about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.\n不抽，我爸是医生，老跟我说些恐怖的故事……说那些鬼神精灵的……完全赞同公主抽烟的权利。\nRachel: And then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!\n她们在抽烟的时候，就背着我做出了决定。\nMonica: That doesn't seem fair.\n这样不太公平。\nRachel: I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting poisonous habit!\n我知道啊！我不同流合污还被处罚！抽烟可是恶心又伤身的习惯。\nChandler: Yeah, it is the best.\n对，抽烟最棒了。\nRachel: I mean what if this keeps happening? You know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions, and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air.\n万一这种事没完没了怎么办？她们在外头抽烟做决定，我只能在办公室里，呼吸愚蠢的新鲜空气。\nRachel: You know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?\n如果金要升我们的职，你们想她会选谁？是我还是乌烟瘴气的冒烟女？\nChandler: You know, we used to have a smoking area at work. It was great. There was this big flowerpot withdirt in it. And we used to put like our cigarettes out in it.\n我们以前的公司有抽烟区，很棒的喔。有个小花盆，里头有土，把烟放进去捻熄就行了。\nChandler: One of the old-timers told me there used to be a little tree in there.\n公司有个元老告诉我，以前里头还有棵小树呢。\nMonica: Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just, say you wanna get some fresh air.\n瑞秋，你也可以一起去，不用抽烟，就说想呼吸点新鲜空气。\nRachel: Yeah, I can do that.\n对，这是方法。\nChandler: Yeah, or you can just do the easy thing and smoke. You gotta take long, deep drags. Wow, I still don't have my lung capacity back yet.\n简单点就是一起抽烟，深深吸它个一口，我的肺活量还没恢复。\nPhoebe: Hey!\n嗨！\nMonica: Hey!\n嗨！\nPhoebe: Oh-hey Rach, you wanna go get coffee?\n瑞秋，要去喝咖啡吗？\nRachel: Aw, I would love to!\n乐意之至。\nPhoebe: Oh, good!\n好。\nChandler: I wanna go too babe.\n宝贝，我也想一起去。\nPhoebe: Oh good. Yay.\n好啊。\nRachel & Chandler: Yay.\n耶！\nPhoebe: All right, I changed my mind! Ok, let's talk about the party! I've so many ideas!\n等等，我变卦了！好，来讨论派对的事，我有一大堆点子。\nMonica: Oh, me too!\n我也是！\nPhoebe: Oh, look at that.\n哦，这个。\nMonica: All right, a little sketch of the cake, see? umm some sample menus, umm you know I thought we'd start out with Tuscan style finger food, ok?\n好，这是蛋糕的素描图，还有一些菜单的样本，不如用意大利风格点心当前菜。\nMonica: And for music, here's an alphabetized list of all of my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that'll go really good with the food.\n至于音乐呢，这是我CD收藏的字母列表，跟食物超搭配的还做了记号。\nPhoebe: What happened to the intimate dinner party?\n不是说要亲密的晚餐派对吗？\nMonica: Oh you know, we're not doing that. Ok...\n现在不那样做了……\nPhoebe: So wow, all right, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.\n看来你全包办了，多谢“共同”主办人。\nMonica: Whaaat? I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!\n怎么了？我没有一手包办啊，你要做的事还有很多。\nPhoebe: Uh-huh, like what?\n举个例子？\nMonica: Cups.\n杯子。\nPhoebe: Cups? You're giving me cups?\n杯子？你让我准备杯子？\nMonica: And ice!\n还有冰块！\nPhoebe: Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, ok, I will be in charge of cups and ice!\n杯子和冰块？我可以负责杯子和冰块？好吧……行，我就来负责杯子和冰块。\nMonica: Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...\n等等，冰块可以从餐厅拿……\nPhoebe: I got it! Mine!\n冰块是我的！\nRoss: Hi.\n嗨。\nMonica: Hey! How'd the audition go? !\n试镜顺利吗？\nRoss: Not so good.\n不太顺利。\nMonica: Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"\n慢着，你在学乔伊那招吗？“试镜不太顺利”事实上很顺利！对吧？\nRoss: Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!\n没错！班取得了第二次试镜的资格！\nMonica: That's great!\n太好了！\nJoey: Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit Cause I actually didn't get a callback.\n对，我得教罗斯我的戏份，因为我没有过关。\nMonica: You got a callback too didn't ya?\n你也过关了，对吧？\nJoey: Yeah I did!\n没错！\nKim: Hey Rachel, what're you doing out here?\n瑞秋，你怎么会来这里？\nRachel: Well, it got kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.\n自己在那里有点无聊，我想来这里呼吸点新鲜空气。\nKim: Nancy and I were just talking about the fall collection.\n南茜和我正好讨论到秋装。\nRachel: Oh great!\n太好了！\nKim: So anyway, we really...Honey, I'm sorry, we're just smoking all over you. Nancy: Oh, sorry!\n所以这是要……抱歉，瞧你被我们熏的。不好意思。\nRachel: Oh that's ok.\n没关系。\nKim: No-no-no, we'll move, you stay right here.\n不成……你待着，我们走。\nNancy: You know I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the lure.\n我把设计寄给罗夫，他很感兴趣。\nKim: Oh, that's great! You are the best!\n太好了，你是最棒的！\nRachel: Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Yeah, you know what, actually...Ok, ok, ok, what's so funny over here?\n不好意思，能给支烟吗？这支就好……你们在聊什么好笑的？\nNancy: I thought you didn't smoke.\n我还以为你不抽烟的。\nRachel: Oh, you know, I-I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, you know? You know what I mean, like doobies?\n我以为你们是说大麻烟，像是大麻香烟那种。\nRachel: And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.\n我还纳闷你们是疯了不成，没啦，我自己也抽烟，天天都抽。\nKim: We get high.\n我们是在抽大麻。\nRachel: Oh, me too.\n我也是。\nKim: I'm kidding.\n我开玩笑的。\nRachel: Oh, me-me too.\n我也是。\nRoss: Oh God, this is so nerve-wracking! How, how do you do this?\n老天，这真是折磨人，你是怎么习惯的？\nJoey: Well, fortunately, I don't get many callbacks, so...\n我过关的经验不多，所以……\nCarol: Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?\n我们在试镜之后被留下来，这是好现象吗？\nJoey: Who knows?\n天知道。\nThe Casting Director: Ok, uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.\n最后入围的是雷蒙、班、凯尔和乔伊。其余的人，辛苦了，谢谢。\nRoss: Yes! I knew it! Bye-bye! So long! Later!\n好耶，我就知道！再会。后会。有期！\nCarol: I'm not married to him anymore! He's my ex-husband! I'm totally gay!\n我不是他老婆喔，他是我前夫，我百分之百是女同志！\nJoey: Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!\n太棒了，我有可能饰演班的爸爸！\nRoss: Yeah!\n耶！\nThe Casting Director: Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So, it'll be either you two or you two.\n其实那是不可能的。因为你们各自的长相都不同，所以我们把你和雷蒙配对凯尔和班是一组，所以最后只有一组会出线。\nJoey: Man, this's gonna be kinda weird.\n要命，这样就有点尴尬了。\nRoss: Yeah, it is.\n真的是。\nKyle: Yeah. It's gonna be weird.\n对，一定会很尴尬。\nRoss: No, we-we're like best friends, that's, that's why it's weird.\n因为我们是最好的朋友，所以才会尴尬。\nKyle: Oh, oh, I, I thought we were just, talking.\n哦……我以为我们一直在谈话。\nChandler: Hey Ross, if Ben gets the commercial, do you think you can get me some free soup?\n如果班拿到广告演出机会，你能帮我弄些免费的汤吗？\nRoss: Chandler, a can of soup is like 60 cents.\n钱德，一罐汤才60美分。\nJoey: Yeah, ok, but I have been supporting a 29-year-old Italian for five years.\n对，但是我这五年来，都在供养这29岁的意大利人。\nPhoebe: Hey!\n嗨！\nRoss and Chandler: Hi!\n嗨！\nPhoebe: Is it ok, if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?\n我能把这些东西放这里，等着给瑞秋过生日吗？\nChandler: Ah sure. What's in 'em?\n当然可以，里头是什么？\nPhoebe: Umm, cups.\n杯子。\nChandler: Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.\n很好，因为我们替瑞秋，准备了八百加仑的水。\nRoss: Seriously that's a lot of cups.\n老实说，这些杯子还真不少。\nPhoebe: Yeah well, that's Cause I'm in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.\n对，这是因为我负责杯子冰块。莫妮卡在这一天将后悔莫及，因为她要我负责杯子冰块。\nChandler: You know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.\n我也后悔过一次，除了后悔没做别的。\nPhoebe: Ok, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!\n好吧，该把其他杯子搬上来了。乔伊！\nJoey: Hey Pheebs! Hey!\n菲比，嗨！\nRoss: Hey!\n嗨！\nJoey: Ross, good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.\n罗斯，你在这里正好，我有事要跟你说。\nRoss: What's up?\n怎么了？\nJoey: Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, you know me going up against Ben, the two of us, competing, and that can't lead to anything good.\n我一直在想这次拍广告的事，我和班对阵，我们俩竞争。这样横竖都不会有好结果。\nJoey: So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.\n我想我还是退出好了，告诉他们我不去试镜。\nRoss: Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.\n乔伊，太好了，多谢。
