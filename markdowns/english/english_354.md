And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life.\n不是，是车子放屁，但我当时以为是有人对我开枪。瑞秋，我劫后余生！我的人生拥有了全新视野。\nRoss: You know? I-I wanna experience every moment.

She didn't want- not important. Point is, I was right. Your decision. Ok? I was right. Your decision.\n因为你知道吗？她不希望…… 那不重要。重点是我是对的，你自己的决定。我是对的，你自己决定要不要回电。\nRoss: Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.\n对。我猜我应该回电给艾蜜莉。\nRachel: Ok, no, that's not the right decision. That's not right, that's not, no Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Ok, Ross, I mean, do you really wanna get back into that?\n不对，你的决定不对……罗斯，你清醒一点！那个女人把你给整惨了！罗斯，你真的想要再来一次？\nRoss: Ok, look, yesterday I wouldn't've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that's gotta mean something, right?\n如果她是在昨天打来的，我压根不会想回电。但在我面对濒死经验的同一天，我的前妻正好打电话来，这一定有所含意，对吧？\nRachel: Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!\n罗斯，那不是濒死经验，就连经验都谈不上了！\nRoss: You weren't there! Ok, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! You know?\n当时你并不在场！或许这就是我应该把握的事。\nRachel: Ok, you know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.\n好吧，你知道吗？或许这无关把握或是不把握，或许这是关于逃避。\nRoss: Huh.\n哈。\nRachel: Ok I mean, look-look today. I mean you escaped death, you know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily.\n就拿今天来说，你逃过了……死亡。或许这是你逃避的机会，不去和艾蜜莉复合。\nRoss: That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.\n还蛮有道理的。因为我要把握住这个机会，不和她见面或联络。\nRachel: Well, th-there you go!\n这就对了！\nRoss: Yeah-ah. Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.\n或许今天只是“差点接电话”日。\nRachel: Close call day.\n“差点接电话”日。\nRoss: Hey, thanks Rach.\n瑞秋，谢了。\nRachel: Ohh, honey no problem. Ok.\n亲爱的，甭客气。\nRoss: Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.\n等等……留言灯在闪，或许留言没被洗掉。\nRachel: Oh?\n哦？\nRoss: "Hey Ross, it's you!"

Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.\n有，一次。小小的一次。算是他自己打的，这不是什么好故事。\nRoss: I wonder how I'd react under fire, you know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like if I was in a war or something.\n不知道我置身战火会怎样？不是汽车放屁，是枪林弹雨。好比我在战场上之类的……\nMonica: Man, I would be great in a war!

He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.\n我知道乔伊会在哪里，他一定会在散兵坑里保护大家。\nChandler: Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.\n对，如果那个散兵坑是用三明治围起来的话。\nJoey: Yeah, hero sandwiches.\n没错，英雄三明治。\nPhoebe: Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war, in any way. But you know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.\n你们知道我主张和平，我对什么战争都没兴趣。不过等到革命的那一天来临，我一定要把你们消灭光光。\nPhoebe: Not you Joey.\n不是你乔伊。
