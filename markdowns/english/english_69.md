Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC News.\nThe United Nation says the humanitarian situation in Yemen is now deeply precarious, and any further destabilization could provoke a famine. The warning from the UN's World Food Program comes as pressure mounts on a month-old ceasefire in the port city of Hodeida, which is a vital gateway for aid supplies to Yemen. In the last few days, a wheat storage facility and a camp for displaced people have come under fire. The UN humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande told the BBC that the food situation across the country remain desperate.\nThere are twenty million people in this country who don't know if they're gonna eat today. Two hundred and thirty-eight thousand people are as we speak, starving. We can't describe this crisis more starkly and this is why humanitarians across the country are insisting that everybody do everything possible to end this conflict. The time has come.\nInvestigators say the captain of a Bangladeshi aircraft which crashed at Kathmandu airport last March was under stress and emotionally disturbed during the flight. All four crew members and forty-seven out of sixty-seven passengers died after the US-Bangla Airline flight crashed. Here is Jill McGivering.\nThe investigator's report suggests the captain was extremely upset during the short flight. He was irritable, tense, moody and aggressive at various times. He said I'm tired because he's slept poor the previous night. He talked obsessively to his young copilot about a colleague's criticism of his performance as a trainer which deeply upset him and his plans to resign. As the plane came into land, his behavior was impulsive and inappropriate, it's said, and he made a series of mistakes which proved fatal for so many of those on board.\nPolice in southern Mexico say at least ten people have been killed in a shoot-out between two local armed groups. The security spokesman in the state of Guerrero said the gun fight took place on a highway in the town of Chilapa had lasted for three hours. Witnesses said the gun fight started when an armed gang attempted to drive through districts controlled by another local militia.\nA powerful tornado has hit Cuba's capital Havana, killing at least three people.
