Hello, I'm David Harper with the BBC News. New York's Attorney General has held the closure of the charity established in President Trump's name as a victory for the rule of law. Barbara Underwood, who is a Democrat, accused the Trump Foundation of engaging in a shocking pattern of illegality. Our north American editor Jon Sopel has more details on the charity. Far from this being a vehicle for giving and philanthropy, the New York Attorney General has described in the most scathing terms how the Trumps were using this for their own purposes. There was a shocking pattern of illegality, including unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign. Repeated and willful self-dealing, this amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests. Trump's attorneys said those accusations were inaccurate and politicized.\nA judge in the United States has delayed the sentencing of President Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn to give more time for him to cooperate with prosecutors. The judge was fiercely critical of Mr. Flynn, saying it could be argued that he sold out his country. Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the US. At a briefing, the White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders expressed the administration's support for Mr. Flynn. The delay is something between General Flynn and the courts, and that's something for them to determine what timeline looks like. In the meantime, we wish General Flynn well, and we'll continue to focus on doing what we do here every single day.\nThe Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has offered his resignation following the withdrawal earlier this month of one of the partners in his governing coalition. Kevin Connolly reports from Brussels. Charles Michel, a French-speaking liberal, has been in government with the conservative movement of Flemish-speaking nationalists, the NVA. When that coalition collapsed last week cause of NVA's rejections to Mr. Michel's decision to agree to the new UN declaration on migration, it left Mr. Michel out on a limb. His resignation is now held in suspension, leaving him as a kind of caretaker Prime Minister. Somehow, Mr. Michel now has to find a way to pass a federal budget. If he can't, the country will edge closer to political crisis. Kevin Connolly reporting from Brussels.\nHuman Rights Watch has called on the authorities in Mali to prosecute militia members and their leaders, saying attacks in the center of the country are spiraling out of control. Earlier this month, an ethnic Dogon militia killed 34 people from the Fulani ethnic group.
