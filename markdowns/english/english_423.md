Ross: Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!\n嗨！各位！感恩节快乐！\nJoey, Rachel and Phoebe: Shhhh!\n嘘！\nChandler: No, no, no. No no no.\n别别别……\nRoss: What are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?\n不能让大家怎么了？今年我们要秘密地过感恩节吗？知道今年有感恩节吗\nChandler: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.\n我们正在玩一个游戏。你得在六分钟内写出美国各州州名。\nRoss: What? That's like insanely easy!\n什么？那太容易了。\nChandler: No, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases, fourteen.\n不，没听上去那么简单。你总是会漏掉一个，某些人会漏掉14个。\nMonica: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.\n这是个蠢游戏，而且没有对抗性，所以理论上讲，我没输！\nRoss: What? You forgot fourteen states?\n什么？你忘了14个州？\nMonica: Nobody cares about the Dakotas.\n没人在乎达科他州。\nChandler: Oh, okay, time's up!\n哦，好，时间到！\nRachel: All right, I got 48.\n好了，我写出48个州。\nChandler: Oh, that's not bad, Pheebs.\n还不错，菲比。\nPhoebe: Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.\n我厌倦了写州名，所以决定写出各种芹菜的名字。我写了一个普通芹菜。\nChandler: Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in vegetables, Joey?\n瑞秋写出48个，菲比在蔬菜名称方面称霸，乔伊呢？\nJoey: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.\n跟钱德勒愚蠢州名游戏的新冠军打声招呼吧。\nRoss: Wow, how many have you got?\n哇，你写了几个？\nJoey: Fifty-six!\n56个！\nJoey: Hey!

But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.\n对了，抱歉，泰格不来了。他女朋友来了，所以他得去陪她过感恩节。\nMonica: Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.\n你为什么没有告诉我，我专门给他做了甜土豆馅南瓜。\nRachel: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know...you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.\n我本来想说的，可后来我意识到，你知道……你做的饭太好吃了，那些南瓜之类的东西绝对剩不下。\nMonica: Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.\n这话太假了，你以为我不会接受。不过我还是很高兴\nPhoebe: Regular Celery!

With time a-to-spare.\n搞定！提前交卷喽！\nChandler: Oh that may be a New World's record.\n唔，这可能是新的世界纪录呢！\nRoss: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called a "globe?" Hmm?\n你知道，我不想在你们面前说教，可你们不觉得羞愧吗？这样一群受过良好教育的成年人，再加上乔伊，竟然不能写出所有的州，你们没看过地图或那种的圆圆的，花花绿绿的叫“地球仪”东西吗？嗯？\nChandler: Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.\n麦哲伦先生？你只答对了46个州。\nRoss: What? That's impossible.\n什么？不可能！\nJoey: 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?\n46个，现在是谁枉费良好教育了，“漏了十个州”先生？\nMonica: I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him!
