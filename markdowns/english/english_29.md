Hayes was a very successful stock trader on the New York stock exchange. He believed that the capacity to survive and to do well is an inherent inborn talent. He would argue he could be a survivor anywhere. I spent my life in the woods, hunting and fishing. I argue on the other hand that survival is more a function of learning certain behavioural tactics to get by, and that they are environmentally specific. And I said to Hayes 'If you come up to New Hampshire and went out in the woods with me, you wouldn't have a chance.'\nA friend of mine sent me sent me a catalogue that had in it a pistol, and it shot a little ball of paint about this big round, and it was used by foresters to mark trees to be cut down and so forth. And I have one of those eureka moments. Two things come together. I called Hayes up, and said 'I've figured out how we are going to prove this argument one way or another.' So I ordered two of these guns, and a bunch of the pellets, and Hayes came up to my house. We decided we'd test these guns out because as far as we'd known, nobody had ever shot a person with them. Hayes shot first, and he missed, and I shout him right it in the butt. And it hurt! So then what we did, we went out into forty acres of woods and Hayes went in one end, I went in the other, and we hunted each other. Within about 20 minutes I came around a big maple tree, and Hayes was sitting on a rock, and I walked right up behind him, and put the barrel of the gun right on his neck, and said 'alright, I don't want to shoot you, who wins?!'\n**参考译文：**\n海斯是纽约证券交易所一位很成功的证券交易人。他相信生存的能力和生存的好的能力是一种内在的天生的才华。他认为他在哪里都能生存。我一辈子都生活在树林里，打猎和钓鱼。我则认为生存更多是学习某些行为策略来存活的能力，这些策略和特定环境有关。我对海斯说：“如果你来新罕布什尔州，和我一起去树林里，你不会有机会的。”\n我的一个朋友给我寄了一个产品样品，里面是一个手枪，它会射出这么大这么圆的彩色的小球，这种小球是森林作业者用来标记要砍的树和干其他事情。然后我就有了灵感。两件事连一起了。我给海斯打了电话说：“不管怎么做，我已经知道了证明这场争论谁对谁错的办法。”然后我订购了两把这样的手枪和一把这样的小球，海斯来到了我家。我们决定测试下这些枪，因为据我们所知，还没有人用它来射人。海斯先射的，射歪了，我直接射到他屁股上了。他感觉疼！后来我们做的事就是我们去了一个占地四十英亩的树林里，海斯去了一边，我去了另一边，我们互相猎杀对方。不到20分钟，我绕到了一颗大枫树边，海斯那时坐在一块石头上，我径直走到他后面，把枪管正架在他脖子上说：“好吧，我不想射你，谁赢了？！”
