Chandler: Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. You know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.\n我想证明我是对的，结果我错了。现在它卡在我的喉咙里。\nMonica: Damn it! You know this whole time we were concentrating on the babies and and no one was watching Chandler!\n真是的，我们光顾着带小孩，都忘了要看着钱德！\nJudge: Ok, you two are asking the court for an annulment?\n两位要申请注销婚姻？\nRachel: Yes your honor, and here're, are forms, all filled out.\n是的，申请表都填好了。\nJudge: So, based on your petition… You are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable?\n根据申请书所言……你申请注销的理由是，盖勒先生的精神状况不稳定。\nRoss: Fine, I'm mentally unstable.\n好，我精神状况不稳定。\nJudge: And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.\n而且他使用静脉注射毒品。\nRoss: What? !\n什么？！\nRachel: Uh yes, heroin and crack.\n是的，海洛因与快克。\nRoss: Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!\n快克根本不是静脉注射毒品！\nRachel: Well, you would know.\n你当然很了解了。\nJudge: Now it also says here that you uh, lied about your sexual preference before marriage?\n这上面还说你在婚前隐瞒性向？\nRoss: Oh, come on!\n拜托！\nRachel: Ross, please, I found the magazines!\n罗斯，我发现那些杂志了！\nJudge: And finally, that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.\n还有你无法履行夫妻间的义务。这也难怪，你是同志，又注射海洛因。\nRoss: Ok, you know you know this's I'm sorry, this is insane!\n很抱歉，这太夸张了！\nRoss: I I I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!\n我没有注射海洛因，我不是同志，我履行什么都没问题！\nRoss: Look, I'll I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!\n我现在就可以在这里履行！\nJudge: That won't be necessary.\n没有这个必要。\nRoss: And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!

Your honor, rest assured, that relationship ended like two years ago! And can you please strike ‘Consummated like bunnies’ from the record?\n法官大人，我们2年前就分手了！可以删掉“跟兔子有得拼”吗？\nJudge: Is there anything, in this record that is actually true?\n这份申请书有任何实言吗？\nRachel: Uh, well, yes, we uh, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names, I think?\n有，我们确实在拉斯维加斯结婚，名字应该也没错，我觉得？\nJudge: That's not the way the legal system works. This process is based on an objective review of the facts, not of the lie.\n这样不符合法律程序。申请注销得根据客观事实，而不是谎言。\nRachel: Objection!\n抗议！\nJudge: It doesn't work like that either.\n这样也不合程序。\nRachel: Overruled.\n驳回。\nRoss: Oh, stop it.\n别闹了。\nJudge: Well, based on what I've heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you don't wanna be together you'll have to file for divorce.\n从刚才的话听来，两位不符合注销资格。如果你们不想在一起，就必须办理离婚。\nRoss: That's great! You happy now?

Stop typing, stop typing!\n不要打，别再打了。别再打了。别打了！别打了！\nRachel: Ok, ok, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married to? !\n你看你让我嫁的是什么人？！\nJudge: You need to get out of my chambers.\n请两位离开我的办公室。\nRachel: All right, look, lady here is the deal. I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!\n好，你给我听着。我是来办注销的，没办成我绝对不走。\nJudge: Would you like to spend the night in jail?\n你们想在牢里过夜吗？\nRachel: Hey thank you for your time.\n耽误您时间了。\nJoey: So the Porsche guy took his car back.\n保时捷的主人把车开走了。\nChandler: But you found the keys to his clothes?\n但你捡到他的衣橱钥匙？\nJoey: No. I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.\n不是，我只是喜欢大家以为我有保时捷的感觉。\nMonica: And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?\n你穿这样别人就会以为你有？\nJoey: Of course!\n那当然！\nMonica: Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car!

We we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!\n但你们不能把我扔给他们！我们是一队的，在打区域联防，他们会以三打一！\nMonica: He's got something plastic lodged into his throat, we've gotta go to the hospital.\n他的喉咙卡了个塑胶玩具，我们非去医院不可。\nPhoebe: But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna you know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.\n但医生也帮不了他，反正过个7年就会自动排出。\nChandler: I think that's gum.\n那是口香糖。\nPhoebe: I'm pretty sure it's gun.\n我确定是死光枪。\nChandler: Ok, listen, this really hurts.
