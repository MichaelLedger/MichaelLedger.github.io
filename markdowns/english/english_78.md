The BBC News with Fiona MacDonald.\nThe European aerospace firm Airbus has announced that it will stop making the world's biggest airplane the A380 superjumbo. The double-decker aircraft was designed to challenge the 747 of Airbus's rival Boeing. Rob Young reports.\nThe era of the Superjumbo is drawing to an end, just thirteen years after the A380 flew for the first time, Airbus says it will stop production with the final plane to be delivered in two years' time. The A380 is regarded as a great technological achievement. It's estimated to have cost about fifteen billion pounds to develop. But Airbus has struggled to sell the giant planes with airlines increasingly turning to smaller, more fuel efficient aircraft for long haul flights. The final nail in the coffin was a decision by Emirates, the Gulf Airline that's been the planes biggest fan to cut substantially its outstanding order.\nThe journalist at the head of an award-winning news website in the Philippines which criticized the country's President has been bailed after spending the night in detention. Maria Ressa, the head of Rappler website was arrested on Wednesday over a libel charge relating to an article published seven years ago. Here's Howard Johnson.\nLots of people have come forward to condemn this move. We've heard from the Vice President of the country Leni Robredo, she said that this is pure political harassment a view that's been echoed by many people in the media here who say that this is a clampdown on freedom of speech. Let's not forget Rapper had urged Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in the past for their coverage of his drug war. Now the president's spokesperson came forward and said that this has got nothing to do with freedom of speech. He says that this is purely a libel case, a private libel case brought by a businessman against Rapper.\nSaudi Arabia has expressed regret at a proposal by the European Commission to add it to a list of countries that don't do enough to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. A report by the official Saudi Press Agency said the Gulf kingdom had taken a number of measures to combat financial irregularities.\nFemale students at a prestigious Indian college have called for the scrapping of a decades-old Valentine's day tradition in which their male colleagues worship a so-called Virgin Tree. Women at the Hindu college in Delhi say the practice of adorning the tree with ribbons, condoms filled with water and posters representing the curvaceous goddess Damdami Mai is patriarchal and misogynistic. The male students say the ritual is a bit of harmless fun.\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\n欢迎收听BBC新闻，我是菲奥娜·麦克唐纳德。\n欧洲飞机制造公司空客宣布他们将停止生产世界最大客机“空中巨无霸”A380。这款双层飞机是空客为了挑战对手波音的747而设计的。以下是罗勃·杨的报道。\n在A380 首次起飞仅13年后，“空中巨无霸”的时代就已经落幕了。空客表示最后一架A380将会在两年内交付，之后将会停产。A380被誉为是一项巨大的科技成就。据估计其研发成本超过了150亿英镑。但是空客在这款巨无霸客机的销售上遇到了问题，因为越来越多的航空公司更倾向于在长途航线上采用体型更小更省油的飞机。导致停产的致命一击还在于阿联酋的海湾航空公司，该公司一直以来都是A380最忠实的粉丝，但现在却大规模削减订单了。\n菲律宾一家新闻网站的著名新闻工作者在经过一夜的拘留后被保释，她曾批评过该国总统。玛丽亚·雷萨是Rappler新闻网的首席执行官，周三她因7年前涉嫌撰文诽谤总统被捕。以下是霍华德·约翰逊的报道。\n很多人站出来谴责该做法。我们从该国副总统莱妮·罗布雷多处得到消息，她表示这是纯粹的政治迫害，这一观点也得到了很多媒体人士的响应，他们称这是对言论自由的镇压。需要记住的是，Rapper新闻网曾在毒品战争的报道中告诫过总统罗德里戈·杜特尔特。现在总统发言人站出来称此事无关言论自由。他表示这纯粹是一起诽谤案，是一名商人起诉这家媒体的私人诽谤案。\n欧盟委员会提议将沙特阿拉伯列入一份名单之中，该名单包括在反洗钱方面力度不足以及资助恐怖主义的国家。对此，沙特表示遗憾。沙特官方新闻社报道称，海湾王国已经采取了大量的措施打击金融不法行为。\n印度一所著名大学的女学生呼吁废除一项数十年之久的情人节习俗，在这一天，男同学将会祭拜一棵所谓的处女树。这所位于德里的印度大学的女性表示，为这棵树装扮上彩带、灌满水的避孕套以及代表‘爱之神’的海报的行为是男权和歧视女性的表现。该校男学生表示该习俗并无恶意。\nBBC新闻。
