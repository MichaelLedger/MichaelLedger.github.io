I mean that thing at the end where the kid...kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that? It's like,"Kid, wait a year. Leave home, do some community theater." I walked out of there and I thought, "That's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back." And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.\n嗯哼。我认为这电影实在是太……无聊了。我是说，那孩子在电影的结局时……自杀了，只因他无法演出话剧？这是搞什么飞机？就好比："孩子，等一年。离家出走，到社区话剧团去"。走出来时我想，"我这逝去两小时的生命，永远不再回"。这想法震惊了我，比其他任何我不敢做的破事更让我害怕。\nMonica: Wow.

Umm, even if he were cornered?\n你的动物园具体在哪儿？就技术上而言不算是动物园。而是一种互动式野生动物体验。我想请教你几个关于马修的问题。好的。它会和其他动物打架吗？不，不会的，它非常温驯。即便是被逼进角落里时（也这样）？\nRoss: Well, I don't know.
