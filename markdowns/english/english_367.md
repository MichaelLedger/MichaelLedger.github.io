And it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Ok, that's a lie.\n没有，但是我告诉你。我的室友狄妮丝就是这样。她搬去跟一个暗地里没有跟她离婚的人住。他嘴上说不爱，其实很爱她。后来事情暴露，所以她才搬来跟我住。好吧，我骗你的。\nRoss: You don't have a roommate.\n你没有室友。\nPhoebe: Denise! No one ever listens to ME!\n狄妮丝！都没有人听我讲话！\nChandler: Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can get them. Now, I have you. Not not that I think that I have you, or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...\n刚才很抱歉，我不需要游戏房。我以前没有女朋友才去打游戏，现在我有了…现在我有了你。我并不是把你当成，或想成一件财产，我对女人……\nMonica: Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.\n别再说了，钱德。我也很抱歉。\nChandler: Really? Monica: Yeah!
