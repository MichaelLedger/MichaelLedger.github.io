He's kind of sexy.\n好啊，他挺性感的。\nOh no, no, I'll be there too.\n不，我也会去。\nOkay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off.\n行，那么我们得想个暗号。如果一切进行顺利，你可以离开。\nNo Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.\n不，我是要你过去陪我。我还没有告诉他我怀孕了。\nOh. Why not?\n为什么？\nBecause I know he's gonna flip out, and I hate it when he's angry.\n因为我知道他会气炸了，我讨厌他生气的样子。\nRachel, this is all so "Papa Don't Preach."\n瑞秋，这跟《爸爸别说教》如出一辙。\nNo, Phoebe, wait. He's a scary guy. I mean, one time he caught me smoking. He said if he ever saw me doing that again, he'd make me eat the entire pack.\n不，菲比，等一下。他非常严厉。我是说，有次他抓到我抽烟。他说如果他再看到我抽烟，他就逼我把一整包烟吃掉。\nWow.

Somebody stop me!\n她用牙解开了他的丁字裤。谁快让我住嘴！\nI thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y' know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.\n我们不是说好不办单身汉或单身女郎派对吗。我们都觉得这个传统很愚蠢。\nIt's a grand tradition!\n那个传统棒极了！\nI'm sorry. They surprised me. There was nothing I could do.\n抱歉，她们给了我一个大惊喜。我真的没有办法。\nWell, you could've untied it with your hands.\n你可以用手解嘛。\nThis is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!\n这太不公平了。我非常想帮我最好的朋友办单身汉派对，却不能那么做。我们只能一起去吃牛排。\nYou went home with the waitress.\n女服务生跟你回家睡了。\nYeah, that was a pretty good night.\n哦是的，那一晚真的很美妙。\nI can't believe you didn't tell me!

Why would you bring me sewage?\n74年？我点的是75年的，那一年的酒味道醇美。74年的酒烂透了！你为什么要给我上那么烂的酒？\nIs that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?\n这个问题很难吗？你是白痴吗？所以你才会来当服务生？\nThis is why I told the manager I wouldn't wait on you tonight.\n这就是我告诉经理今晚不想为你服务的原因。\nOh, come on. Don't be such a baby.\n少来了，别那么幼稚。\nIn case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.\n你应该注意到了，他真的很吓人。\nHe's right, though. The '74 is absolute piss.\n但他说得对，74年的酒真的很难喝。\nThis was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't. I can't. I can't.\n这是个天大的错误。我不敢告诉他，菲比，我做不到。\nRachel... No, it's okay.\n瑞秋…… 没事。\nThis is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple of years, and then the baby will tell him.\n这样吧，我再等上几年，然后宝宝会告诉他。\nWhy?

Oh, no. Please don't tell me it's her.\n孩子的爸爸是谁？不，拜托，别告诉就是她。\nNo, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross.\n不，是罗斯，你喜欢罗斯。\nOh daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You're gonna-This is your first grandchild! You're gonna be a poppy!\n爸爸，我希望你能接受这件事。想一想，这是件好事。这是你第一个外孙！你要当外公了！\nThat's true. Poppy!

Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.\n你得老实说。不然的话，你以为你们的方向一致，事实上你们走上了不同的道路。\nI'm gonna take that book and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.\n我要把那本书抢过来，拿它把你打死。\nOh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.\n天啊，你一定会爱死我的。关于单身女郎派对的事，我真的很过意不去。所以今晚你要办单身汉派对。\nWhat?\n什么？\nYeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what? !\n我在餐厅的同事给了我一个电话号码，我雇了一个脱衣舞娘来跳舞给你看。我可以进太太名人堂了吧？\nHoney, that's crazy.

It'll make me feel so much better.\n来吧，一定会很好玩的。这样会让我觉得好过一点。\nLook, I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy. You know I'm not a bachelor anymore.\n听着，我很感激。但这样有点奇怪。我已经不是单身汉了。\nSo don't think of it as a bachelor party. Think of it as a two month anniversary present.\n所以别把它当成是单身汉派对。把它当成是结婚两个月的礼物。\nSure. One year is paper, but two months is lap dance.\n当然，结婚一年是纸婚，两个月的话可以看艳舞。\nPlease, I feel so bad. Just watch the hot woman get naked!\n拜托，我觉得好过意不去。就去看看那个辣妹脱光衣服吧！\nAll right fine!

Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.\n我们假装这是你结婚前的单身汉派对。那样比较好玩。\nAll right. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.\n好吧。我不敢相信明天是我的大喜之日。\nHow does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again?\n知道你再也没法跟别的女人在一起你有什么感觉？\nKnowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face every day until you finally have the sweet release of death.\n知道你每天醒过来都会看到同一张脸，直到死神来拯救你。\nYou're right.
