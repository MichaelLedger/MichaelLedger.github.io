This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Jonathan Izard. Police in Britain are questioning a man and a woman who have been detained on suspicion of involvement in the illegal use of drones near Gatwick, the country's second biggest airport.Passengers are being warned of further disruption because of a backlog caused by the cancellation or diversion of about a thousand flights. Jenny Kumah is in Gatwick with the latest. They have made two arrests in connection with that criminal drone activity and they say that proactive investigations are still ongoing and they're asking the public to contact them if they have any further information. It's very busy here, lots of people making that Christmas getaway, but there are delays. The airport is hoping to run around seven hundred and fifty flights today. We know that already six have been cancelled and there are some delays on other services.\nTwo explosions in the Somali capital Mogadishu have killed at least a dozen people, including a prominent television journalist. Awil Dahir Salad was travelling in his car with other employees at the station Universal TV who were also killed. Mercy Juma reports from Nairobi. The first car bomb went off at a checkpoint near the presidential palace in Mogadishu. The second explosion took place just minutes after, covering huge parts of the capital in smoke. Police say politicians and other officials were near the site of the blasts. One of the injured is the deputy governor of Barnard region. Images circulating on social media show destroyed vehicles in debris littering the streets. Islam's terrorist group al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the twin blasts which have shattered nearly a month of calm in Mogadishu. a town there is often the target of attacks by al-Shabaab.\nA sixth consecutive Saturday of protests by the yellow vests movement is beginning in France. In Paris which has seen violence in recent weekends, some demonstrators gathered Montmartre and in the centre of the city. The anti-government protests started over planned rises on fuel taxes but also focus on wider living standards. This protester called on President Macron to deal with the high cost of living. The government doesn't want to help all its citizens get out of penury, help them live a dignified life, dignified, because the salaries, salaries must be salaries. You can't live on them, stop with your one hundred euros, two hundred euros. It's nothing. It's nothing. The cost of living is way up high. Bring it down so that France can succeed. A tenth person has died linked to the demonstrations after a driver crashed into the back of a lorry at a yellow vest roadblock near the southern city of Perpignan. This is the world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，大家好，我是乔纳森·伊泽德。英国警方正在审问一名男子和一名女子，他们因涉嫌在英国第二大的机场盖特威克机场附近非法使用无人机被捕。旅客受到警告航班将会进一步中断，因为约一千架次航班被取消或者转移导致旅客滞留。以下是简妮·库玛的报道。警方已经抓捕了两名与非法操纵无人机有关的嫌犯，他们还表示主动调查正在进行中，他们还要求了解更多信息的公众与他们联系。机场十分忙碌，很多人都在进行圣诞旅行，但是碰到了航班延迟。机场希望今天可以飞750架航班。我们了解到已经有六架次被取消，还有一些其他服务的延迟。\n索马里首都摩加迪沙的爆炸导致至少十二人死亡，其中就包括一名知名的电视节目记者。阿维尔·达希尔·萨拉德当时正与环球电视台的其他员工乘车经过这里，他们也都不幸遇难。以下麦茜·祝马在内罗毕的报道。第一枚汽车炸弹在摩加迪沙总统官邸附近的检查点爆炸，第二枚也在几分钟后爆炸，爆炸引起的烟雾覆盖了首都的大面积区域。警方称政界人士和一些官员当时正在爆炸区域附近。受伤的人群中就包括巴纳德区的副区长。社交网络的传出的图片显示汽车碎片散落在街上。伊斯兰恐怖组织索马里青年党宣称对这两次袭击负责，袭击打破了摩加迪沙一个月以来的平静局面，该镇经常遭到青年党的袭击。\n法国连续第七个周六的“黄马甲”抗议活动开始了。在最近的周末，巴黎发生了不少暴力活动，游行者聚集在蒙马特尔以及城市中心地区。反政府抗议者以计划汽油税上涨为由发动游行活动，但是他们同样关注的是生活水平的巨大差异。抗议者要求总统马克龙处理生活成本过高的问题。政府并不想帮助所有民众摆脱贫困，或是帮他们过上有尊严的生活，人们的薪资必须是实实在在的薪资。而现在的工资已不足维持生活，一两百欧元的薪资根本微不足道。生活成本现在变得太高，只有下调才能让法国变得强大。由游行导致的第十起死亡事故发生，在法国南部城市佩皮尼昂的黄马甲路障附近，一名司机与一辆货车追尾。BBC国际新闻。
