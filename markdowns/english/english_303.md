Like-like Exxon.\n还没，好难喔，翻这本书也没收获，我想取个勇猛有自信，例如埃克森（美国最大的石油制品公司之一）。\nChandler: Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.\n很适合姓瓦尔德斯的小孩（埃克森·瓦尔德斯号油轮）。\nJoey: Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?\n你要勇猛的名字？绿巨人如何？\nPhoebe: No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."\n绿巨人不太好，不过我喜欢什么“人”的。\nJoey: Oh, you want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."\n想取好名字？就取乔伊，乔伊是好朋友，好兄弟，人都在哪里？都跟乔伊在一起。\nChandler: Hey, you know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.\n要取乔伊，还不如取钱德。\nOh, come on!

But, all right, I don't- maybe I will just name him The Hulk.\n跟心爱的人同名的想法很好，乔伊和钱德都是很棒的名字，但是我不...... 或是就叫绿巨人好了。\nJoey: I knew I shouldn't've mentioned it!

He's a guy.

For, for like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is, is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."\n这个情节太熟悉了，我和卡萝分手前整整半年，我整天只听到 “我朋友苏珊好聪明”“我朋友苏珊好风趣” “我朋友苏珊好棒”。\nChandler: You actually think that something could happen between Emily and Susan?\n你觉得艾蜜莉和苏珊会擦出火花？\nRoss: Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y' know they-they take a steam together!

What's wrong with Ross?\n罗斯有什么不好？\nPhoebe: Well, it's just you know that something like this would never happen to like The Hulk, you know...\n就像笨船一样永不会发生的。\nRoss: Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found...you know, ugh, never mind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.\n那不是真的，那“难以置信的笨船”72号，布鲁斯班乐医生发现了——你知道算了，我的女朋友是同姓恋。\nPhoebe: So, I decided I'm definitely gonna go with either Joey or Chandler.\n我一定会在乔伊和钱德里选一个的。\nJoey: Oh! Oh, oh, what, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.\n你一定要选乔伊！有哪个名人叫钱德？\nChandler: Raymond Chandler.\n雷蒙钱德。\nJoey: Someone you didn't make up!\n你捏造的人不算！\nChandler: Ok, there are no, famous Joeys.

What if it's, you know, Chanoey?\n加起来除以二如何？例如，钱道伊？\nChandler: Ok, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. I mean there's never gonna be a President Joey.\n乔伊，你想嘛！他绝对当不上总统，绝对不会出现乔伊总统。\nJoey: All right look man, I didn't wanna bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life!\n听着，我本来不想提的，但钱德是我听过最蠢的名字，\nIt's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Ok? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not!\n它根本不是名字，连个词都不是，它有点接近chandelier（吊灯），但又不是，\nAnd then you put it together with Bing and forget about it! It's a stupid, stupid non-name!\n再配上“宾”就更别提了，它是个蠢到爆的非名字。\nChandler: Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.\n天哪，你说得对，我的名字烂透了。\nJoey: I'm sorry man, I didn't- I'm-I'm sorry.
