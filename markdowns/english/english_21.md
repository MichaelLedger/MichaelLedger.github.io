I have been so lucky to be living here for the last year. My parents, my brothers and sisters, I've sent them so many pictures and they don't believe it because for me this house is a place where I used to see in a movie, in an old English movie. The only reason that I left Syria and my brother who's two years older than me left was the government army, which we didn't want to join. We didn't want to hurt people, we didn't want to kill people.\nThat's not us. This is not what our religion taught us. I was hoping to come back in six months time. So, I was like: 'Mum I'm going to see you in six months time.' But here I am after seven years and I didn't see her. I started my journey through Turkey, Greece, the boat. Complete horror and just, just pure fear. We ended up in the Calais Jungle. The most horrendous place I've ever been in Europe. I've got to the UK, applied for asylum. I met this really nice lady who helped me when I was having trouble with accommodation and I met with the Chair and Trustee of this house, of Southside House. I have always felt lucky in this place. So mostly I work in the garden. I think they say I have green fingers. Green fingers? Is that right? I grew up in a very beautiful farm house with my parents, with animals. And I used to help my mum in the garden. My mum grew vegetables.\n![](images/english-house.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n我过去一年都住在这里，感觉自己太幸运了。我给我的父母还有兄弟姐妹发了很多照片，他们不相信我住在这，因为对我来说，这样的房子只存在于我过去常常看的电影里，英国老电影里。我离开了叙利亚，比我大两岁的哥哥也离开了，我们离开的唯一原因是因为政府军，我们不想加入政府军。我们不想伤害人，我们不想杀人。\n那不是我们想做的事。这不是我们的宗教教我们做的事。我当时希望六个月后就可以回去。所以当时想说：妈妈，我六个月后去看你。但是我在这里七年了，我没有去看她。我是从土耳其和希腊开始我的旅程的，做船。充满了恐怖，纯粹的恐惧。我们在加来丛林结束了旅程。那是我到欧洲后去过的最可怕的地方。我到了英国后，申请了避难。我遇到了这位非常善良的女士，她在我住宿遇到麻烦时帮助了我，我和这个房子——“南侧房”的主席兼受托人见了面。在这个房子里，我总是感觉很幸运。大部分时间我都在这个花园工作。我想他们说我有“绿手指”。绿手指？对吗？我在一个非常漂亮的农舍长大，还有父母和动物陪伴。我过去常常在菜园里帮我妈妈干活。我妈妈种菜。
