I'm Stuart Mackintosh with the BBC News, hello.\nThe British Prime Minister Theresa May has survived a vote of no confidence in her leadership of the governing Conservative Party. The Party's Members of Parliament backed her by 200 votes to 117 in a secret ballot. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg has this assessment.\nThis was a clear result in favor of the Prime Minister, but also a clear picture of a party in conflicts and a result brokered only by a promise from Theresa May to go, if not just yet. She'll have now what a loyal minister described as a little more time. And yes Tory rules say that she can stay on undisturbed by the same kind of challenge for another twelve months. But while she is temporarily safer, Theresa May has less clout. A Prime Minister with a sell-by date holds less sway.\nPresident Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress and violating US Election Finance Laws. Nada Tawfik is at the court in New York.\nMichael Cohen hung his head and shook it in disbelief when the sentence was read. He was hoping for no jail time, but the judge ultimately imposed three years in prison. Substantial but still on the lower end of sentencing guidelines. The judge said that Michael Cohen had lost his moral compass and should have known better as a lawyer, and he said that no future cooperation could be taken into consideration in sentencing.\nFrance remains on its highest level of security alert as the search continues for a gunman who shot dead two people near a Christmas market in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The authorities have issued a photo of the suspect. The French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has announced the deployment of hundreds more soldiers across the country.\nAs of today, five hundred soldiers have been added to the force, and in the coming days, thirteen hundred will join those already mobilized. The objective is to secure sites open to the public, particularly Christmas markets.\nThe United States has warned Turkey against carrying out unilateral military action in northern Syria. The Pentagon said such a move would be of grave concern and could jeopardize US troops helping to fight the Islamic State group. The statement was issued after Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his forces would begin a military operation against a US-backed Kurdish militia in the region.\nYou're listening to the world news from the BBC News.\n![](images/conservative-party-vote.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n我是斯图亚特·麦金托什，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n英国首相特蕾莎·梅挺过执政党保守党对她领导能力的不信任投票。在无记名投票中，党内国会议员给她投了200个支持票和117个反对票。以下是我台劳拉·昆斯伯格的观点。\n对于首相来说这明显是一个有利的结果，但是这也清楚地表明了党内存在分歧，而这一结果的促成源于特蕾莎·梅离任的承诺，离去只是时间问题。正如一名拥护她的大臣所说，她现在又多了一些时间。按照保守党的规定，一年内不会对她发起不信任投票。尽管她暂时安全一些了，但是特蕾莎·梅的影响力已不如从前。一个被加上“保质期”的首相，其影响力也会下降。\n特朗普总统的前私人律师迈克尔·科恩因对国会说谎以及违反美国选举财务法被判刑三年。以下是那达·托菲克在纽约法庭的报道。\n当法官宣判时，迈克尔·科恩俯首摇头，不敢相信这样的结果。他本希望不会被判入狱，但是法官最终判了他三年的刑期。虽获刑，但也是按照量刑标准从轻宣判。法官表示迈克尔·科恩丧失了道德准则，身为律师知法犯法，法官还表示宣判结果没有商量的余地。\n法国仍处于最高级别的安全警戒状态，同时也在继续搜寻一名枪手，周二他在斯特拉斯堡的一家圣诞节市场附近枪杀了两人。政府已经发布了嫌犯的照片。法国总理爱德华·菲利普宣布在全国范围内再部署数百名士兵。\n截至今天，已有500名士兵加入武装力量，接下来的几天里还会有1300名士兵加入到队伍中。他们的任务就是保护开放的公共区域，尤其是圣诞节市场。\n美国警告土耳其不要在叙利亚北部发动单方面军事行动。五角大楼表示这样的举动将会引起严重关切，也会危害帮助与伊斯兰国组织战斗的美国的士兵的安全。在此声明发布之前，土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安曾表示他的军队将会对该区域内美国支持的库尔德民兵组织发动军事行动。\n您正在收听的是BBC新闻。
