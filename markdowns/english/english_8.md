This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Jonathan Izard.\nWorld leaders are in Buenos Aires for a G20 summit already marked by tensions and disagreements, many of them caused by President Trump's combative stance on trade and climate change. Tensions have been further inflamed by Russia's military action against Ukraine. James Landale is at the summit. President Putin is likely to face tough questions over Russia seizure of Ukrainian vessels. President Trump said he wouldn't meet the Russian leader until the confrontation was resolved. And Mohammad bin Salman the Saudi Crown Prince is also in town looking to repair his reputation after the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But for all these tensions, European leaders said it was important for the G20 to come together to tackle the world's problems.\nBefore the summit formally got underway, the United States, Canada and Mexico signed a new trade deal. This is seen as a victory for Mr. Trump who opposed the previous agreement. Andrew Walker reports. Many barriers to commerce between the US, Canada and Mexico were removed or reduced by the North American Free Trade Agreement, which came into force a quarter of a century ago. But President Trump called it the worst trade deal ever. Now, the three leaders have signed a replacement which keeps much of the original agreement. But it includes additional provisions that will, for example, make it more expensive for car makers to use parts from outside the region and will mean more opportunities for US dairy farmers to sell their milk products in Canada. It has been a contentious negotiation and there were reports that late disputes about the dairy issue might have held up the signing ceremony.\nInternational Olympic Committee says it's freezing all planning for the boxing tournament at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics because of concerns about the sport's governing body. It's launching an inquiry into the International Boxing Association AIBA over its governance, ethics and financial management. Our sports correspondent Alex Capstick reports. The IOC halted preparations for the Olympic boxing tournament in Tokyo, including the qualifying process following talks among the organization's leading officials in the Japanese capital. For several months, serious concerns have been expressed over the way the sport's governing body has been run. It came to a head earlier this month when Gafur Rahimov was elected as president of AIBA, despite allegations that he's part of an international criminal network, something he's always denied. But whatever is ultimately decided regarding the future of AIBA, the IOC still wants boxing to be part of the Tokyo Games.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n![bbc-20181204.jpg](images/bbc-20181204.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n这里是BBC新闻，大家好，我是乔纳森·伊泽德。\n世界各国领导人现正在布宜诺斯艾利斯参加G20峰会，峰会已表现出了紧张和分歧，许多是因为特朗普总统在贸易和气候变化上的好斗态度引发。俄罗斯对乌克兰采取的军事行动又进一步加重了大会的紧张氛围。以下是詹姆斯·兰德尔的报道。普京很有可能会因俄罗斯扣押乌克兰船只而面临尖锐的提问。特朗普表示在对峙解决之前他不会与普京见面。沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨尔曼也来到了这里，试图挽回一下因沙特记者贾马尔·哈苏及被杀事件而受损的名声。虽然本次大会充满了紧张气氛，欧洲领导人表示最重要的是各国能聚在一起解决世界问题。\n在峰会正式开始之前，美国、加拿大和墨西哥签署了一份新的贸易协议。这被认为是特朗普的胜利，因为他反对之前的协议。以下是安德鲁·沃克的报道。北美自由贸易协定消除或降低了很多美国、加拿大和墨西哥之间的贸易壁垒，该协议在25年之前正式生效，但是特朗普称这是有史以来最差的贸易协议。现在这三名领导人已经签署了一个替代协议，保留了很多之前的协议内容。但是也新增了一些附加条款，比如汽车生产商使用该区域之外零件将会更加昂贵，另外也会更有利于美国奶农向加拿大销售奶制品。协商的过程很激烈，有报道称近期的乳制品问题争端或延长签字仪式。\n国际奥组委称正在冻结2020年东京奥运会的拳击比赛筹备工作，原因其管理机构存在问题。它正在对国际拳击联盟AIBA的管理情况、道德和金融状况进行调查。以下是本台体育通讯员亚历克斯·卡普斯蒂克的报道。国际奥组委停止了东京奥运会拳击比赛的筹备工作，包括资格赛，此前奥组委主要官员在日本首都举行了会谈。几个月以来，国际奥组委一直都在担心该体育机构的运作方式。本月初，加弗尔·拉西莫夫成功当选 AIBA主席，事情也达到了非做不可的地步，拉西莫夫被指是国际犯罪网络成员，但他本人否认。无论AIBA的前景如何，国际奥组委仍然希望拳击项目出现在东京奥运会上。\nBBC国际新闻。
