Chandler: All right, I'm off to see your dad.\n好的，我要去见你爸。\nRoss: Whoa whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?\n哇哦哇哦，你不会穿太多了吗？\nRachel: Yeah, and you better make sure he tips you this time.\n这次记得拿小费。\nChandler: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face. And by face I don't mean his lap.And by face, I don't mean my ass.\n我想说服他别再提那件事，我想最好的办法就是跟他面对面谈一谈。我说的"面"指的不是他的大腿。而对的那个"面"，也不是我的屁股。\nRoss: Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?\n嗨，你们有给莫妮卡和钱德勒订婚礼物么？\nRachel: I don't know.

I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.\n对对对。我还记得她驾驶她爸的船带我出海。她完全不让我插手。\nRachel: I don't wanted…Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.\n我不想…对不起，我想要你帮我。但你连动都动不了，因为你穿了三件救生衣。\nRoss: You have to respect the sea!\n你得保持对大海的敬畏之心！\nRachel: Look Joey, I'm sorry if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something.That was not mean.Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.\n乔伊，如果你觉得我很刻薄，对不起。但我告诉你，那不是刻薄。我爸才刻薄，以前在船上，他总会对我大吼大叫。那真的很可怕，我只是想当个称职的老师。\nJoey: Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!"?\n好老师会说，“放下啤酒，白痴！”吗？\nRachel: Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?\n好学生会在上第一堂课时喝掉七罐啤酒吗？\nJoey: Six and a half!

Oh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's.This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.\n这是第二十二批，或许它们会有你外婆的神髓。我放了一些陈皮，没有放肉豆蔻。\nRoss: Let's give it a shot.\n试吃吧。\nMonica: Okay.

Because we could just work off of those.\n第17批还有剩吗？我们可以研究那些啊。\nRoss: Yeah, oh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!\n第17批还剩一个，呃……是第16批！第16批！别挡路！\nRachel: Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good!\n乔伊亲爱的，你做得真得很好！\nRachel: All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side.\n好了，现在我要你移到左舷。\nRachel: Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?\n记得吗？记得我们说的左舷么？\nJoey: Oh yeah.\n记得。\nRachel: Right?\n好？\nJoey: Nope.\n不记得了。\nRachel: It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.\n是左边，甜心，但是没关系，这个容易搞混。\nJoey: I don't know why you just don't say left.\n我不明白为什么你不直接说左边。\nRachel: Okay, go to the left.\n好吧，过去左边。\nRachel: The left.\n左边！\nJoey: Huh?\n啥？\nRachel: Just sit over there!\n坐到那边去！\nJoey: Okay!

It was gross!\n你教我的时候，有只鸟，嘴巴里叨着鱼飞过去。你看到了吗，那真的很恶心。\nRachel: No! All right? ! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!\n我没有看到鸟或鱼，也没有看到形状像泰森的泡沫塑料，我没有看到，因为我忙着教你驾驶船。而这明显是一项不可能的任务。\nJoey: All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!\n又来了！你又吼了！而且我没见你裸上身。我放弃了\nRachel: What do you mean you quit? !

I just wanted you to learn.\n我没有，我只是在离你比较近的地方大吼大叫。天啊，乔伊，我就跟我爸一样。天啊，这真的太可怕了。我很努力不要跟我妈一样，却没有注意到这一点。我真的很抱歉，我只希望你能学会。\nJoey: Well, hey I did learn.\n我学了。\nRachel: Really?\n真的吗？\nJoey: Yeah! Come on.\n没错，来吧。\nJoey: Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I know port is right.\n没事的。我知道主帆是什么。我知道船桅过来时一定要低头。我知道左舷是右边。\nRachel: Left.\n左边。\nJoey: Damnit!\n该死！\nPhoebe: You know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's looking up at us and smiling right.\n我外婆会很开心我们想方设法要弄清楚她的秘方。我敢说她正抬头看着我们，对我们微笑。\nRoss: Looking up?\n抬头？\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.\n不对吗？她对我真得很好，但是她肯定在地狱。\nMonica: Well, I've tried everything.

Kids love that right.\n我已经努力过了。我放弃，我没办法成为做出全世界最好吃曲奇饼的妈妈。但我做最好吃的西兰花配油封鸭。小孩子很喜欢吃那道菜吧。\nRoss: Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?\n菲比，没有任何亲戚有这个秘方？比如你的姐妹？\nPhoebe: Oh no no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening till October 15,2032.\n不，我跟自己发过誓除非我死掉，不然我不会再跟厄休拉说话。那一天将会是2032年10月15日。\nRoss: That's the day you're gonna die?

You know, I'm a little…I'm a little embarrassed about it.\n所以你要了解，如果你不说出去的话我会觉得好受多了你知道，在这件事上我有点尴尬。\nMr.Geller: I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.\n我完全理解。最可怕的事莫过于在岳父母面前丢脸了。事实上，我开始跟朱迪交往时，我根本就没有工作。她爸问我是干什么工作的。我说我是律师。\nChandler: What did you do when they found out?\n他们发现了以后你怎么办？\nMr.Geller: They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along.
