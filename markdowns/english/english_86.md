Hello, I'm Nick Kelly with the BBC News. A Judge in Brazil has agreed to release from prison the former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to attend the funeral of his seven-year-old grandson. The boy died of meningitis and will be buried on Saturday. Leonardo Rocha reports. Lula will fly from the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba in a jet that belongs to the local government. He will be leaving the federal police compound where he's serving his sentence for the first time since he was imprisoned in April. Lula rejects the corruption allegations and says he was imprisoned by his political opponents to prevent him from running for office again last year. For many, he led the most corrupt government in Brazilian history, but the country is split politically and thousands are expected to turn up at the cemetery to show the support for the former president.\nThe United States has cancelled the visas of forty-nine Venezuelan officials who helped close the country's borders last Saturday to block the delivery of foreign aid. The US State Department said the officials were responsible for undermining Venezuela's democracy. The sanctions were also applied to their family members. President Nicolas Maduro rejected the offer of humanitarian aid donated mainly by the US, saying it was a pretext for a ground invasion.\nThe American space agency NASA and California SpaceX company preparing to launch astronaut capsule from US soil for the first time in eight years. The Dragon capsule will blast off on board a Falcon 9 rocket and will carry a dummy fitted with sensors to the International Space Station. NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier says using a private company won't compromise on standards. We're doing things that are really risky and the designs and the complexity of what we have to do. We're strapping human beings on top of rockets with millions of pounds of thrust, hurling them into orbit to go attached to a space station to do world-cutting research. That isn't trivial.\nThe US ambassador to London has described the European Union as a museum of agriculture with a traditionalist and unsustainable approach to farming. In an article for a British newspaper, Woody Johnson writes that criticism in Britain of American farming is part of a smear campaign by those who want to prevent a trade deal between the US and the UK after Britain leaves the EU. Earlier this week, the US set out its objectives for such a trade deal, which would force the UK to abandon European food standards.\nThe court of appeal in Quebec has upheld a ruling in a lawsuit ordering three big tobacco companies to pay more than eleven billion dollars in damages to smokers and ex-smokers in the Canadian province. The plaintiffs alleged that the companies had known since the 1950s the tobacco cause cancer and had failed to warn consumers.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼克·凯利，欢迎收听BBC新闻。巴西的一名法官同意释放前总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦，让其参加7岁孙子的葬礼。这名男孩死于脑膜炎，将于周六埋葬。以下是莱昂纳多·罗查的报道。卢拉乘当地政府的飞机从巴西南部城市库里蒂巴出发。他将离开巴西联邦警察局，去年四月份他被判入狱后现正在此服刑。卢拉否认了腐败的指控，并表示他是被政治对手关进监狱的，目的是防止他在去年再次竞选总统。对很多人来说，他曾领导了巴西历史上最为腐败的政府，但是巴西现正在政治分裂，预计数千人将会现身葬礼，以表示对前总统的支持。\n美国取消了49名委内瑞拉官员的签证，因为他们在上周六帮助关闭该国边境，阻碍了国外救援物质的运输。美国国务院表示这些官员要对破坏委内瑞拉的民主负责。美国同样对他们的家人实施了制裁。总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗拒绝了主要由美国提供的人道主义援助，表示这是地面入侵的借口。\n加州的SpaceX公司和美国宇航局NASA准备发射8年来首个在美国国土上发射的载人飞船。“龙”飞船将会由猎鹰九号火箭发射升空，并将搭载装有感应器的人体模型飞往国际空间站。NASA的比尔·斯坦玛雅表示用私人公司不会降低标准。我们正在做的事情风险非常大，要做的设计难度和复杂程度也很高。我们正在将人置于火箭力，用数百万磅的推力将他们送往轨道和空间站对接，来做一些世界尖端的研究。这些都不是很容易就能做到的。\n美国驻伦敦大使将欧盟称为“农业博物馆”，称其在农业中仍使用传统和不可持续的方法。在英国报纸的一篇文章中，伍迪·约翰逊写道在英国对于美国农业的批评是一项诽谤活动，他们想要在英国脱欧后防止美国和英国达成贸易协议。本周早些时候，美国发出了贸易协议的标准，这将会强迫英国放弃欧洲的食品标准。\n魁北克的上诉法庭维持了烟草公司诉讼案的原判，判决三家大型烟草公司支付超过110亿美元给加拿大魁北克省的吸烟者和已经戒烟的人。原告称这些公司在上世纪50年代就知道烟草导致癌症，但是没有警告消费者。
