The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\n今天我所做的就职誓言是对所有美国人的效忠。\nFor many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry,\n几十年来，我们以美国工业的衰落为代价为别国的工业输送营养，\nsubsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.\n为别国军队施以援助，但对我国军力的耗损视而不见。\nWe defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own.\n我们曾经致力于保卫其他国家的领地，却忽略了我们自己的领土。\nAnd spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.\n我们曾经将成千上万亿美元转移到海外，我们自己的基础设施却年久失修、长年荒废。\nWe've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.\n我们帮助其他走上了富裕之路，我们自己的财富、力量和自信却逐渐消失在地平线上。\nOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.\n我们的工厂一个接一个倒闭，而我们成千上万被落在后面的工人被长久忽视。\nThe wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\n我们中产阶级的财富被剥削，再被分配给世界其他国家。\nBut that is the past and now we are looking only to the future.\n但这些都是过去了，我们现在要看向未来。\nWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power.\n我们今天聚集于此，是为了颁布新的命令，让它在每个城市、每个国家的首都、每座权力的殿堂回响。
