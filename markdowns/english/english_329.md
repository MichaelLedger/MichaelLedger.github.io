I think you killed us.\n莫妮卡，这真是史上最棒的感恩节大餐，太好吃了。你把我们撑死了。\nRoss: I couldn't possibly eat another bite.\n我连一口都吃不下了。\nJoey: I need something sweet.\n我要吃点甜的。\nPhoebe: Does anyone wanna watch TV?\n有人想看电视吗？\nAll: Yeah, sure.\n好啊。\nPhoebe: Monica your remote doesn't work.\n莫妮卡，你的遥控器按不动。\nMonica: Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.\n你得把它拿起来对准。\nPhoebe: Oh. Aw, forget it.\n算了。\nRachel: Hey, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.\n你们知道吗？我们应该来玩感恩告白游戏。\nJoey: Ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.\n我要说！感谢今年的秋天这么美。\nMonica: That's very nice.\n说得真好。\nChandler: That's sweet, Joe.\n说得真好。\nJoey: Yeah, the other day I was at the bus stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up.\n那天我在等公车，突然吹来一阵秋风，把一个女生的裙子吹了起来。\nJoey: Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.\n对了，我还要感谢丁字裤。\nJoey: I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering.\n与其说它是内裤，不如说是一种伟大工程。\nJoey: I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! I mean is it there, is it not there?\n料子那么少，效果却那么大。它还会戏弄你，有穿吗？没穿吗？\nChandler: Are you aware that you're still talking?\n你知道你还在唠叨吗？\nMonica: Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?\n有没有人要感谢丁字裤以外的东西？\nRoss: Huh, I don't know what to pick.

It's just that this is the worst Thanksgiving ever.\n抱歉，这是最惨的一次感恩节。\nChandler: No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriageand take that away from me.\n不不不，我才是悲惨感恩节之王。你不能以失败的婚姻为理由抢了我的宝座。\nRachel: No, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?\n你又要说你爸妈离婚的事了？\nRoss: Oh God, no.\n上帝啊，不要。\nJoey: No, no, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!\n别这样嘛，我想听。没有钱德扫兴就不算感恩节了。\nChandler: See, it's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.\n这跟游行一样是一项传统，如果游行也包括同性恋和抛妻弃子的话。\nMrs. Bing: Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce doesn't mean we don't love you.\n钱德，爸爸和我要离婚，并不代表我们不爱你。\nMrs. Bing: It just means he would rather sleep with the houseboy than with me.\n只是代表他上床的对象是男仆，不是我。\nThe Housekeeper: More turkey Mr. Chandler?\n钱德先生还要火鸡吗？\nRachel: Every time you tell that story that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.\n你把那家伙的口音说得越来越重。\nPhoebe: So are he and your dad still together?\n他们还在一起吗？\nChandler: No no no. After they got their own place, the houseboy got his own houseboy. Should've heard his accent.\n没有，他们同居之后男仆自己也有了男仆。你应该听听他的口音。\nRoss: You're right. Yours is worse.

More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying...Oh no.\n还要绷带！还要绷带！再给我一些绷带，这个人快……哦，不！\nRoss: In this life, Phoebe.\n今生的才算，菲比。\nPhoebe: Oh, this life! Oh ok no, Chandler's is worse.\n今生是吧，那钱德的比较惨。\nJoey: Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.\n记得前世的事一定很酷，我都没有前世的记忆。\nPhoebe: Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.\n当然没有，你是新生命。\nRachel: I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.\n我知道莫妮卡最惨的感恩节。\nMonica: Oh, let's not tell this story.\n那个就别提了。\nAll: Oh, come on!\n说嘛。\nPhoebe: Oh no, I know! I know!

Plus, it smells really bad in here.\n那就赶快帮我拿下来，而且这里面好臭。\nPhoebe: Of course it smells bad. You have your head up a dead animal's ass!\n当然很臭，你的头塞在动物尸体的屁股里。\nPhoebe: Oh! Oh! Monica. Oh.\n是莫妮卡。\nMonica: Hey!\n嗨！\nPhoebe: Hey!\n嗨！\nMonica: Hey, did you get the turkey basted - Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?\n你替火鸡涂……我的天哪！那是谁？\nJoey: It's Joey.\n乔伊啦。\nMonica: What-what're you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?\n你在干什么？你是在搞笑吗？\nPhoebe: No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.\n不是搞笑，是吓人。\nMonica: Well, get that off now!\n马上给我拿掉！\nJoey: I can't!

I scared you!\n我知道，我吓到你了！\nChandler: You did look like an idiot.\n你看起来真的很白痴。\nJoey: Yeah, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.
