I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great. I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\n我敬各位一杯。来一杯，叮叮。我知道这不是你们本来计划的感恩节， 但是对我来说这样也挺棒的。我想，这是因为它没和离婚或者呕吐沾边。不论如何，我在想，如果你去了韦尔，如果你们和父母在一起，如果你没有得“梅毒”那些玩意我们就不能一起过。所以我想说的就是：谢天谢地你们的感恩节计划都砸了。\nAll: That's so sweet.\n真是感人！\nRoss: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.\n来，祝你们有个讨厌的圣诞节。\nRachel: And a crappy New Year.\n还有一个糟糕的新年。\nChandler: Here, here!\n干！干！
