He he won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.\n我也是！钱德勒就受不了。他都不让我在家吃蓝纹奶酪。\nAnd you're still married to him?\n那你还嫁给了他？\nYou know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese. Not even bread. Just cheese. No, I want the bread.\n知道我想干嘛吗？我想去法国，只吃面包跟奶酪。甚至连面包都不吃，只要奶酪。不，我要面包。\nAnd pastries. And pate. Oh I'm really not high.
