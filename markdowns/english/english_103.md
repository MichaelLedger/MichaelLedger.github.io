BBC News. Hello, this is Jerry Smit.\nIran has breached the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. European signaturees have attempted to stick to the deal, despite the US withdrawal last year. Washington has since impose sanctions. Here is the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner.\nIran is being choked off economically and so far Europe has failed to convince Iran that it can offer enough of carrot to keep it within the deal.\nSo Iran is starting to ratchet up the pressure. The next step is expected on July the seventh in just six day's time when Iran has hinted that it's gonna start enriching uranium beyond the 3.6 percent, which is the cap set under this accord. Why does that matter? Because it makes it that much easier to race to the point at which you could produce a nuclear bomb.\nThe Afghan Interior Ministry says at least three people have been killed and scores injured in a car bomb attack in the Afghan capital Kabul. The blast took place in an area housing government buildings. Officials say two gunmen have been shot dead.\nThe chief executive of Safaricom, Kenya's largest telecoms firm Bob Collymore has died. He was sixty-one and has been suffering from cancer. He steered the company to unprecedented levels of profitability. The BBC's Africa business editor Larry Madowo said Mr. Collymore knew how important Safaricom was to ordinary Kenyans.\nThey feel that this is a uniquely Kenyan company and he understood that. He never tried to talk down on the citizen. He did understand that it occupies an important part of the national narrative. In a mobile phone industry where all the other competitors did make money, he made much more money than all of them combined and he was always very humble about that.\nIn the Netherlands, the man accused of shooting dead four people on the tram in the city of Utrecht in March has appeared in court for his first hearing in public. Gokmen Tanis, a Turkish-born Dutch resident faces multiple provisional charges of murder or manslaughter with terrorist intent. This report from Anna Holligan.\nGokmen Tanis wore a track suit and long beard. He was flanked by three police officers. The thirty-seven-year-old has already confessed to the killings but has refused to choose a lawyer or answer questions, telling the court he did not recognize its rules. Prosecutors said a note he left on the dashboard of a stolen car suggested a terrorist motive. It read, I do this because of my face. You are making Muslims dead. God is great!\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，大家好，我是杰瑞·施密特。 \n伊朗违反了2015年与世界大国签署的核协议所规定的浓缩铀储备限制。尽管美国去年退出该协议，但欧洲签约国仍意图遵守这项协议。华盛顿当局随后实施了制裁。以下是BBC安全通讯员弗兰克·加德纳的报道。\n伊朗在经济上受到了限制，到目前为止，欧洲未能说服伊朗其能够提供足够的好处以继续维持核协议。所以伊朗开始加大压力。下一步措施预计将于7月7日进行，也就是6天后，伊朗暗示将开始将铀的浓缩度提高至3.6％以上，3.6%是该协议规定的上限。为什么这件事这么重要？ 因为这将会让伊朗更加轻易地达到可以生产核弹的程度。\n阿富汗内政部表示，在阿富汗首都喀布尔发生的汽车炸弹袭击事件中，至少有三人死亡，数十人受伤。爆炸发生在政府大楼区域内。有关官员称两名枪手已被击毙。\n肯尼亚最大的电信公司Safaricom的首席执行官鲍勃·科利莫尔去世，享年六十一岁，且患有癌症。他带领公司达到了前所未有的盈利水平。BBC的非洲商业编辑拉里·麦朵渥称科利莫尔知道Safaricom对普通肯尼亚人的重要性。\n人们认为这是一家独特的肯尼亚公司，他明白这一点。他从不试图贬低民众。他清楚地知道该公司在民族发展进程占据着重要的部分。在所有竞争对手都赚钱手机行业，他赚的钱比所有竞争对手加起来都多，但他对此总是非常谦虚。\n在荷兰，3月份被指控在乌得勒支市的电车上枪杀4人的男子首次出庭公开听证会。土耳其出生的荷兰居民哥克曼·塔尼斯面临多项带有恐怖主义意图的谋杀或过失杀人暂时指控。以下是安娜·霍利根的报道。\n哥克曼·塔尼斯身穿田径服并留着长胡子。他被三名警察押解到了法庭。三十七岁的他已经承认杀了人，但拒绝选择律师或回答问题，并告诉法庭他不承认其法律。检察官称，在一辆被他偷来的车上，有一张纸条留在了仪表盘内，纸条表明了他的恐怖主义动机。纸条上写着，我这样做是因为我的脸。你们正在逼死穆斯林。真主万岁！\nBBC新闻。
