The mayor of London is Sadiq Khan.\nIn London, we've got a public health emergency. People are changing their behaviors already and the point of this policy is to lead to a bigger change of behavior. You know there are one five children in London, they go to primary school where the air is illegal. We think because of our policies we will govern situation where there are four hundred fifty schools in areas with air is illegal to five in 2020 and zero by 2025.
