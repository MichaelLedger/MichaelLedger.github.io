Hello, I'm Eileen McKue with the BBC News.\nThe sister of India's main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has formally joined politics months ahead of general elections. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been appointed as one of the General Secretaries of the Congress Party. Here's Yogata Lemoye.\nWith just months to go for the national election, Ms Gandhi's appointment is being seen as a major push by the Congress Party to try and win back power in India. In 2014, it's suffered a humiliating defeat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP party. Questions have often been raised about the popularity of the Congress' President Rahul who is Priyanka Gandhi's brother. In comparison, she thought to be more charismatic and someone who connects easily with voters. The siblings come from India's leading political family.

Some union leaders and human rights activists remain in hiding.\nRussia has given foreign military attaches a briefing on a contentious new missile system, and it again insisted it's in full compliance with a key arms control treaty dating back to the Cold War.
