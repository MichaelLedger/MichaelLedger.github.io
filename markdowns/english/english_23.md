BBC news. I'm John Shea. Tens of thousands of police have been deployed across France in preparation for the latest protests by the "yellow vests" movement. Paris has been shaken by some of the most serious rioting in decades over the last two weekends. Indications so far are that fewer people will join the demonstrations this week. Here's Hugh Schofield. After President Microns offered to open up the state's coffers on Monday, some in the "yellow vests" movement have acknowledged that that was a major step forward and they are calling for a pause. Others fear that the violence at the last two Saturday protests, much of it actually caused by young opportunists rather than bona fide protestors, is damaging the cause. But there are still "yellow vests" surround the country who feel that now is not the time to ease up the pressure. They feel that if Macron has given once he can give again.\nThe UN climate conference in Poland has been extended to allow negotiators more time to finalize a deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The talks continued through the night on contentious issues, including how poor countries should be compensated for the damage caused by global warming.\nMahinda Rajapaksa has announced his resignation as Sri Lanka's prime minister. In a statement, he said he had no intention of continuing in the post without a general election being held. With the details here's Anbarasan Ethirajan. Mahinda Rajapaksa who strongly believes in astrology, signed his resignation letter in an auspicious time during a religious ceremony held at his home in Colombo. He was controversially appointed two months ago by President Maithripala Sirisena to replace Ranil Wickremesinghe, triggering a political crisis in Sri Lanka. But he failed to command a majority in Parliament and a court also restrained him from acting as Prime Minister. In a statement, Mr. Rajapaksa said his resignation would make way for the president to form a new government. There are suggestions that Mr. Rajapaksa's resignation could lead to Mr. Wickremasinghe returning to power on Sunday.\nThe Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said his country now recognizes West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But in a speech in Sydney, Mr. Morrison said the Australian embassy would not be relocated from Tel Aviv until the final status of Jerusalem was resolved. He said the decision took him to account the interests of both sides. Australia now recognizes West Jerusalem, being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel. Furthermore, recognizing our commitment to a two-state solution, the Australian government is also resolved to acknowledge the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a future state with its capital in East Jerusalem.
