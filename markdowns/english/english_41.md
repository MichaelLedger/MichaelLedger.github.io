Hello, I'm Nick Kelly with the BBC News.\nPolling stations have opened in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo for the country's long delayed presidential election. It could result in the country's first peaceful transfer of power. President Joseph Kabila is stepping down after seventeen years. From Kinshasa, Louise Dewast reports.\nAs polling stations open across this vast country, almost the size of Western Europe, tensions are high. It's still unclear if all polling stations are ready. For the first time, voting will be done using electronic voting machines despite concerns they could be used to rig the vote in favor of the ruling party's candidate. The front runners are Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, a close ally of President Kabila, and two opposition candidates Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi.\nBangladesh is holding a general election with more than a hundred million people eligible to vote. Heavy security is in place after a campaign marred by violence and allegations of a crackdown against the opposition. The Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is seeking a third successive term. Yogita Limaye is in Dhaka.\nEven before eight am when polls opened, there were lots of people waiting outside. It is still largely a paper ballot, so it's on a piece of paper that they will make their choice. But for the first time in a national election in Bangladesh, electronic voting machines are also being used in six constituencies. In the run-up to this election, we've seen several violent instances, several people being killed, scores being injured. And so there's a heavy security deployment all across the city as well as the country and in fact, even mobile internet has been slowed down for security reasons.\nThe Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo says his government is investigating a possible plot to assassinate the President Ivan Duque. He said investigators were trying to establish where the three Venezuelans arrested earlier this month in Colombia with military weapons are connected to the alleged plot.\nFor several months, intelligence services have been investigating possible attacks on the life of the president. On top of this, we have the recent capture of three Venezuelan citizens who were found with weapons of war. This increases the concerns of the authorities in this matter.\nPresident Duque is due to meet the US Secretary of State next week to discuss escalating tensions with Venezuela. He's asked countries not to recognize the new government of the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼克•凯利，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n刚果民主共和国东部的总统选举投票站已经开放，该国总统选举被长期推延。这可能将是该国权力的首次和平移交。总统约瑟夫•卡比拉在执政17年后即将下台。以下是路易斯•德瓦斯特在金沙萨的报道。\n刚果民主共和国幅员辽阔，接近整个西欧的大小，随着投票点的开放，紧张气氛也日益增加。现在还不清楚是否所有的选举点都做好了准备。在投票中将首次使用电子投票机，虽然有人担心这些机器会被用来操纵投票，从而为执政党候选人谋利。得票领先的候选人包括伊曼纽尔•拉马扎尼•沙迪尔，他是总统卡比拉的亲密盟友，以及两名反对党候选人马丁•法尤鲁和费利克斯•齐塞克迪。\n孟加拉国正在举行大选，有资格投票的选民超过一亿。因为此前选举期间的暴力活动和以及对反对党的镇压活动，严格的安保措施已经就位。总理谢赫•哈西娜正在寻求第三届连任。以下是尤吉塔•利玛耶在达卡的报道。\n在早上8点投票开始之前，就有很多人在外等候。投票形式绝大部分都是纸面选票，也就是说人们将会在纸上做出自己的选择。但是在孟加拉的全国大选中，电子投票机也首次在六个选区使用。在选举的准备阶段，我们看到了一些暴力事件，数人被杀，多人受伤。所以现在有大量的安全力量被部署在该市以及全国，甚至移动互联网都因安全因素而降速。\n哥伦比亚外长卡洛斯•奥尔梅斯•特鲁希略表示政府正在调查疑似密谋刺杀总统伊万•杜克一案。他表示调查人员正在尝试找到本月初在哥伦比亚逮捕的三名持有军方武器的委内瑞拉人与这起刺杀阴谋的联系。\n几个月以来，情报人员一直在调查有可能对总统发起的刺杀行动，此外我们还逮捕了三名携带战争武器的委内瑞拉市民。这也增加了政府对该事件的担忧。\n总统杜克将于下周会见美国国务卿，讨论与委内瑞拉不断升级的紧张关系。他呼吁各国不要认可以尼古拉斯•马杜拉为总统的委内瑞拉新政府。\nBBC国际新闻。
