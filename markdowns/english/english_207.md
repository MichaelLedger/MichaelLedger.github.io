I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh?\n我觉着你说这话不公平！你看到我一次就怕了，还有好多夜里你没看到我呢？\nWhat about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?\n比如说你昨夜里起来喝水，我还好心躲在门后没让你看到呢，那又怎么说呢？\nI didn't realize that.

I'll go move into my brother's basement and when he finds out I'll go find some place else.\n好的，好的，我懂了，知道吗？我走。知道我会做什么吗？我会搬到我兄弟的地下室去。等他发现了，我再找地方。\nYou know what? I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow. I heard that.\n知道吗？我会在你明天下班前搬走。我听到了。\nHey. Hey.\n嗨。嗨。\nHey. Wheell, look at you, finally got that time machine working huh?\n哇，看看你！终于用时光机回到过去了啊？（Joey 戴了一顶老式帽子）\nSeriously, you like it? This guy was selling 'em on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I thought, you know what I don't have?\n说真的，你觉得怎么样？有个人在第八大道上卖帽子，我看见以后就想，你知道我缺什么吗？\nA mirror?\n镜子？\nFine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.\n你就笑话我吧，我觉得很时髦。\nWow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.\n哇，对于一个刚失业的人来说，你心情很好啊。\nHey, I'll be all right.

I mean that's gotta have some kind of cachet.\n不要紧的，我又不是要从头开始，我可是《我们的日子》里面的德瑞克雷莫瑞大夫。那可以算是项储备吧。\nCachet? Jaunty?\n储备？时髦？\nChandler gave me word of the day toilet paper.

It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.\n瑞秋，这本书你一定要看。书名是《掌握自己的风》，讲的是女人需要拥有更多的权力。\nYeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes our wind? Men, they just take it.\n对，但是有风，风能够让我们成为女神。知道谁夺走我们的风吗？是男人。他们就那样夺走了。\nMen just take our wind?\n男人夺走我们的风？\nYahuh, all the time, 'cause they are the lightning bearers.\n对啊，一直如此。因为他们是闪电使者。\nWow. Yeah.\n哇哦。对。\nWell that sounds kinda cool, it's kinda like The Hobbit.\n听起来挺酷啊。有点像是霍毕特人啊（《指环王》中的穴居小矮人）。\nIt is nothing like the Hobbit. God it's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, exexcept for Richard.\n跟霍毕特人不沾边，就像是在读我的每一段感情。跟理查的除外。\nOh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.\n嗯，对，理查绝不会偷走你的风。\nNo.\n是啊。\nNo, 'cause he's yummy.\n因为他很可口。\nYes. But all the other ones.\n是啊，但是其他人都会。\nOh yes.

Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my phallic shaped man cakes?'\n看，这就是典型的闪电使者行为。就是他这样，就像是说，“嗨，谁要来一根我的老二形状的蛋糕？”。\nWho have you been dating?\n你跟谁约会了？\nDon't worry about it already. Things happen.\n别担心！人有祸福。\nSo, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?\n所以我这次被炒鱿鱼，你不生气吗？\nJoey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?\n乔伊，看着我，看着我！我牙上有口红印吗？\nNo, can we get back to me?\n没有。说回到我的问题上，好吗？\nLook honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.\n听着，亲，这一行到处有人被炒鱿鱼。我已经帮你搞到了《另一个世界》的试镜机会。\nAll right. Cab driver number two?\n太棒了！计程车司机乙？\nYou're welcome.\n不用谢哈。\nBut I was Dr. Drake Ramoray. How can I go from being a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?\n我可是演过德瑞克雷莫瑞大夫的。怎么能一下从神经外科医生变成计程车司机呢？\nHey, there was a time when I used to play pickle tickle with Rick Harrison. Things change, roll with them.\n我还曾经跟雷克斯哈里森搭档演过小淘气呢。世事无常，随遇而安吧。\nBut this is a twoline part, it's like taking a step backwards.

See ya.\n不好意思。改天见。\nOh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so\n天啊，天啊，这本书真...\nIsn't it?\n没说错吧？\nUhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book couldcould've been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.\n感觉就像是在读我自己的人生啊！这本书甚至可以叫做《掌握自己的风，瑞秋！》。\nI don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would've made a nice gift for you.\n那样的话就不会卖一百万本了，但要当礼物送给你倒蛮合适的。\nHi, guys.\n嗨，大家伙儿。\nHey.\n嗨。\nUh, sweetie we've gotta go.\n亲爱的，我们得走了。\nNO!\n我不走。\nNo?\n不走？\nNo, why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?\n不走！为什么我们做什么事都得照你的时间表来呢？\nActually it's the movie theatre that has the timetable. So you don't miss the beginning.\n事实上，我们照的是电影院的时间表。这样我们才不会错过电影开头啊。\nNo, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.\n不，这不是电影院的事儿，而是你偷了我的风。\nYou go girl. I can't pull that off can I?\n加油，姑娘！我就做不到她那样，是吧？\nExcuse me, your, your, your wind?\n什么？你的，你的风？\nYes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?\n对，我的风。你不让我吹，我怎么成长？\nYou, you know I, I don't, have a have a problem with that.\n你知道我不介意你“吹”啊。\nOk, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now.

Damn it!\n没错，我不需要跟他道歉。抱歉。该死！\nWhat is it?\n怎么了？\nI, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.\n不知道啊。就是关于什么风呀树呀，还有什么神圣的池塘。我真没弄明白，但她很生气。\nSee, this is why I don't date women who read.\n这就是为什么，我不跟看书的女人约会。\nUh oh.\n啊哦。\nWhat, what's that?\n那是什么？\nIt's my VISA bill. 'Envelope one of two.' That can't be good.\n我的信用卡帐单。两封里的一封。感觉不妙啊。\nOpen it, open it.\n打开看看，打开看看。\nOh my God.

Ahh.\n乔伊，那只是最低还款金额，总金额在这里。啊啊！\nWhat, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?\n你在“狩猎陶瓷”花了3500块？\nMy animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused.

What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.\n但是我不知道啊。我只知道你欠“缤纷世界”2300块。\nHey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.\n罗斯，我知道我欠多少。\nOk, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.\n那就讲一点道理啊。你奋斗了十年才得到医生那个大角色。谁知道下一个机会还要等多久？\nLook, I don't wanna hear this right now.\n我现在不想听这个！\nHuh, I'm just saying...\n我只是说...\nWell don't just say.\n那就别“只是说”！\nYa know, maybe, maybe I should just go.\n或许我该走了。\nOk.\n好啊。\nOk.

He's a lot feistier than the last one.\n哦，对，看，我买了一条新的金鱼，它比上一条活泼多了。\nMaybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look, Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?\n大概是因为上一条是培珀莉农场（知名饼干公司）做的吧。艾迪，是不是有件事你现在必须要去做呢？\nWell, not unless it's got something to do with the hydrating, my man, 'cause right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!\n除非是跟脱水有关的。因为我现在是脱水狂！\nLook you have to help me out here.
