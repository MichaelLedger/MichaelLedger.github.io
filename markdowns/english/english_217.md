Can you believe that, me, not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.\n我试镜完之后…比提先生过来跟我说“好演技，烂吻技”。你们相信吗？我…我吻技会烂？那就好像…好像是说特丽莎修女（有“妈妈”意思）不是个好妈妈一样。\nWell, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. You know, what's Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.\n好了，谁在乎他怎么想。华伦·比提懂什么叫做接吻？\nHey, what'd your agent say?\n你经纪人怎么说？\nYep, this kiss thing is definitely a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.\n接吻这回事绝对是个问题，比提先生星期一要再看一次。\nMan, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.
