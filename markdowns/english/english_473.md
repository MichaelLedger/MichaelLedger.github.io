Yeah!\n好可爱哦！ 是啊。\nAnd look. See how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born they're great for shoplifting melons.\n你看，宝宝越长越大，它们也会跟着撑开来。宝宝出生后可以穿它去偷西瓜。\nOh good, you're all here. Okay. Thanksgiving, tomorrow, four o' clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?\n太好了，你们都在。感恩节，明天四点。你猜我邀请了谁？还记得高中同学威尔·卡佛特吗？\nNo. He was in Ross' class.\n不记得。 他跟罗斯同班。\nMarching band, was kind of overweight. Well, really overweight.

And this is what we do!\n没错。因为我是崔比亚尼家的人！这是我们的专长。\nI mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damn it!
