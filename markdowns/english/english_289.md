I just, I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person you know.\n嘿！嗯，谢谢你来见我。我只是很高兴能以我的亲身经历和你聊聊生儿育女的事情。\nPhoebe: Ok.\n好吧。\nPhoebe Sr. : Uh, I really don't think it's a very good idea Phoebe.\n菲比，我真的认为你不应该那么做。\nPhoebe: Why not?\n为什么？\nPhoebe Sr. :Well, because, you'd be giving up a baby. And, I, I really don't,\n嗯，因为你将要把孩子送交给别人，怎么和你说呢。\nI don't know if there's anything I could say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby, so, um...\n我不知道怎么说才能让你理解放弃孩子时的那份痛楚，因此\nPhoebe: Oh no no, I understand. Don't, don't hurt the puppy.\n喔，不！不-不！我理解那痛的感觉！别，别伤害这个小狗。\nPhoebe Sr. :No no no, the-the puppy is yours.\n不-不，这个小狗是你的啦。\nPhoebe: Oh, I get a puppy?\n哈哈，我有小狗了！！\nPhoebe Sr. :Well yeah. I mean yeah, but, for only three days.\n嗯，对！是的，但只是3天。\nPhoebe: Why?\n为什么？\nPhoebe Sr. :Well, you know, I-I realize that I don't have any right to start getting all parenty on you and everything now, but, um, er...\n我知道我没有权利像母亲一样管你，但是，喂\nPhoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.\nPhoebe，你能不能先听我说，而不是玩小狗，这事非常重要。\nPhoebe: Ok.\n好。\nPhoebe Sr. :I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies.\n我是说，我知道自己以前做了什么，我抛弃了2个孩子，\nAnd, I only wish that I had someone there who had given up babies who could've told me, how terrible it is to give up babies.\n而且我真的希望当时身边有个抛弃过孩子的人可以告诉我抛弃孩子的感觉是多么的糟糕。\nAw, I really shouldn't've given you the puppy first.\n我真不应该先给你小狗。\nPhoebe: That's ok. No we're listening.\n没关系，我专心听你说。\nPhoebe Sr. :I just think that, it would be something that you would regret every single day for the rest of your life.\n我只是在想，那么做的后果将会是遗恨终生。\nSo, however hard it is, for you to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child.\n因此，不管你要放弃这个狗有多么的难，放弃一个孩子要比那难上一万倍。\nPhoebe: Ok, fair enough. Three days.\n好，很合理，就养三天。\nPhoebe Sr. :Aw, it's time to take my ass out of the kiln.\n该把屁股拿出烤窑了。
