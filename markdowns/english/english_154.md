In fact, he mentioned the word "frenzy."\n是的，她还在这儿。我没用备忘录通知你吗？是这样，我开除她之后，接到了她心理医生Fl……Flennan，Flynn的电话。他说她一时无法接受这个消息。老实说，他提到"狂暴"这两个字。\nMr. Douglas: You're kidding!

Ross?\nCarol，Carol，亲爱的，深呼吸。我知道你很惶恐，但是往长远想想，生产过程只是一天。结束之后我们这辈子都是他的父母了。我是说，怀胎生子为的不就是这些吗？Ross？Ross？\nRoss: I'm gonna be a father.\n我要当爸爸了。\nRachel: It's just occurring to you?\n你才刚知道吗？\nRoss: I always knew I was having a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me.

But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.\n或许吧。但是这也无法解释他们为什么总是拿走我的剪刀。\nChandler: Uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise.\n啊，这样，可能是因为你被升职的缘故。\nNina: I am?\n我升职了？\nChandler: Sure.

Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: If you're ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand on the desk.\n坦然接受。拿钉书机钉我除外。给你们个提示，以后遇见类似的状况切记别把手放在桌上。\nMonica: Okay, I think I get how to do this.\n好了，我想我知道怎么调了。\nPhoebe: All right, so, can we turn this off? Just, just make itmake them go away? I can't, I can't look.\n好吧，就是，我们能关掉它吗？就是，就是让它关掉，我没法看了。\nMonica: Okay, Pheebs, they're gone. Are you all right?\n好了，Pheebs，关了。你还好吧？\nPhoebe: Yeah.\n还好。\nPhoebe: It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing.\n就是，我是说，就是Ursula的事。\nRachel: Ok, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?\nPheebs，我能问吗？他就是和她约会了。我是说，真有那么糟吗？？\nPhoebe: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything.\n嗯，是的。听我说，我不是说她是很坏。\nPhoebe: She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff.\n她就是总弄坏我的东西。\nPhoebe: When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus.\n我8岁的时候，我没给她我的Judy Jetson热水壶，她就把给丢到公车下面去了。\nPhoebe: And then when I was twelve, she broke my collarbone.\n我12岁的时候，她弄断了我的锁骨。\nPhoebe: All right, I mean, she didn't mean to do it, but I think it still counts.\n好吧，我是说，她不是故意的，不过这也算。\nPhoebe: And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?\n然后，哦，有个Randy Brown，他就是，你们有没有过男朋友又是你最好的朋友的情况？\nMonica & Rachel: No.\n没有。\nPhoebe: Well, that's what he was for me. And she, you know, kind of stole him away and then broke his heart. Then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, you know, or anything, but...\n好吧，我当时的状况就是这样。她呢，她把他抢走又伤了他的心。他从此不和我说话。因为他说他不愿再见像她的人。我知道Joey不是我男朋友或者热水壶或其他的什么，但是……\nChandler: You're not gonna lose him.\n你不会失去他的。\nMonica: You gotta talk to Joey.\n你得跟Joey谈谈。\nPhoebe: Yeah.\n没错。\nRoss: Come on, he doesn't know this stuff.

Rachel!\nRachel！Rachel！\nRachel: I'm okay! I'm okay!\n我没事！我没事！\nRachel: Mr. Heckles? Mr. Heckles, could you, could you help me, please?\nHeckles先生？Heckles先生，能不能，能不能帮我一下？\nMr. Heckles: See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.\n看吧，我说的就是这种事。
