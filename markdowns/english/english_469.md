Yay!\n那么是谁？ 我请了一个女佣，耶！\nI hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…\n我希望你所说的"女佣"是指"情妇"，因为如果有其他女人在打扫咱家房子的话……\nUh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control…\n亲爱的，我知道你不喜欢让出控制权……\n"Relinquish" is just a fancy word for "lose."\n"让出"就是"失去"的委婉说法吧。\nLook, she's really nice. Okay?

I'm apartment hunting.\n不行，我很忙，我在找房子。\nYou're moving?\n你要搬家？\nYeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, "How you doing?"\n孩子生下来后我不可能跟乔伊一起住。我不希望我的孩子会说的第一句话是"你好吗？"\nSo does does Joey know you're moving?\n乔伊知道你要搬家吗？\nWell, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved.\n我还没有跟他谈，但我知道他会觉得如释重负。\nLast week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.\n上星期他带了一个女孩回家，而我跟她谈晨吐的问题。还把我怀孕纪念册的照片拿给她看。\nThat's not really porn?
