Hello, this is David Austin with the BBC News. The two main political parties in Nigeria have condemned the country's electoral commission for postponing the presidential and parliamentary elections hours before polling was due to start. The head of the commission is Mahmoud Yakubu. This will afford the commission the opportunity to address identified challenges in order to maintain the quality of our elections. This was a difficult decision for the commission to take, but necessary for the successful delivery of elections and the consolidation of our democracy. Mr. Yakubu said legistical problems had made it impossible to hold the vote on schedule, but both the governing All Progressives Congress and the opposition People's Democratic Party criticized the commission for not being prepared and then accused each other of trying to manipulate the vote. Both have urged calm.\nThe Roman Catholic Church has defrocked the former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick over allegations of child abuse. The Vatican said Pope Francis had ruled his expulsion from the clergy as definitive and would not allow any further appeals against the decision. Theodore McCarrick was the former Archbishop of Washington D.C. Martin Bashir reports. Theodore McCarrick was informed of the church's decision to remove him from the priesthood last night. And a terse statement from the Vatican this morning said that he'd been found guilty of sins against minors and adults with the aggravating factor of the abuse of power. Last July, he resigned as a cardinal, the first to do so in more than a hundred years, after credible allegations emerged that he'd sexually assaulted a sixteen-year-old altar boy and then molested another fourteen-year-old.\nIndia's fastest train has broken down a day after it was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi with much fanfare. Anbrathan Antirajon has the story. The state-of-the-art Vande Bharat Express was returning from the Indian city of Varanasi after its first outing when the brakes reportedly jammed in one of the carriages. Soon after that drivers noticed a smoke in the last four coaches, and power was lost in all compartments. Those on board, mostly railway officials and journalists, had to take another train to get back to Delhi. Some reports said the express had hit a stray cow. The train is expected to reduce the travel time between Delhi and Varanasi by six hours. The new train service is expected to start its commercial run from Sunday. And that's the latest BBC News.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是大卫·奥斯汀，欢迎收听BBC新闻。尼日利亚选举委员会在投票开始几小时前推迟了总统和议会大选，该国两大政党对此表示谴责。以下是马哈茂德·雅库布的讲话。该决定将会让委员会有更多时间处理已发现的问题，从而保证选举的质量。这对于委员会来说也是一个艰难的决定，但是对选举的成功交接和民主的稳定来说是必须的。雅库布表示出于法律问题要推迟原定的投票时间，但是执政的“进步国会”党和反对党人民民主党都批评了选举委员会准备不足，然后互相谴责对方企图操纵选举。双方都敦促冷静。\n罗马天主教教会就虐待儿童的指控免去了前主教西奥多·麦卡里克的职务。梵蒂冈方面表示，教宗方济各已经开除了他的神职，并且不允许对该决定提起上诉。西奥多·麦卡里克曾是前华盛顿特区的大主教。以下是马丁·巴希尔的报道。昨晚，西奥多·麦卡里克收到教会通知开除了他的神职。今天早晨梵蒂冈的一份简短声明表示，已认定他严重滥用权力，对未成年人和成年人犯下罪行。去年七月，他辞去了主教职务，这也是一百多年来的首次，原因是证据确凿的指控称他性侵了一名16岁辅祭男孩，并且猥亵了另一名14岁的男孩。\n由总理纳伦德拉·莫迪隆重宣布的印度最快火车在一天后出现故障。以下是安德布里森·安迪罗杰的报道。先进的的范德·巴拉特快车当时正从印度城市瓦拉纳西返回，据报道，首次发车之后一节车厢的制动器卡住了。司机发现最后四节车厢冒烟不久后，所有的车厢失去动力。车上大部分都是铁道官员和记者，他们不得不坐另一辆火车返回德里。有报道称火车撞上了一头离群的牛。据悉，该火车预计可以将德里和瓦拉纳西的行程减少6个小时。新的火车服务预计将在周日开启商用。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。
