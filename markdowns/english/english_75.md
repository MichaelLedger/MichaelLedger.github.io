Hello, I'm Debbie Russ with the BBC news. Police in Paris say they believe a fire that engulfed a residential building during the night killing eight people was started deliberately. The Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said a woman who lived in the building had been detained. At this stage, the information we have points to criminal activity as the main line of investigation. One person has been arrested, a person who lives in the building. This person was arrested during the night, not far from the scene, not far from the fire, and she's currently in custody. Residents say the woman had psychiatric problems and had been involved in a dispute with a neighbor, a fireman over loud music during which she threatened to set fire to the building. At least thirty other people have been injured in the blaze at the eight-storey building in the west of the French capital.\nThe former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and a delegation of influential opposition figures are meeting the Taliban in Moscow for political talks. Last month, hopes were raised when the Taliban and US officials apparently drafted the framework for an initial peace deal. But Afghan government officials are not taking part in the talks as the Taliban are refusing to meet them. Secunder Kermani reports. The insurgents have resisted American demands that they engage directly with President Ashraf Ghani's National Unity Government, which they dismissed as illegitimate. Those taking part in the talks say there is an opportunity to start a dialogue between the Taliban and important power brokers in Afghanistan, but some in Kabul see them as an attempt by political rivals to undermine the Afghan government, an exploring deal with the Taliban behind their backs.\nState media in Ethiopia are reporting that more than two hundred people have been arrested in the west of the country where they were receiving illegal military training. It says they were stopped by the army and police close to the Sudanese border, where ethnic clashes have displaced tens of thousands of people. The security forces in Burkina Faso say they've killed a large number of militants in response to an attack in which fourteen civilians were killed in the north of the country. The military said armed men attacked the village of Kain in Yatenga province on Sunday night. A military statement said the Burkinabe army conducted a large scale operation in three northern provinces, reportedly killing 146 militants.\nUS government scientists have published an unscheduled update to their model of the Earth's magnetic field to deal with the speeding-up of the magnetic North Pole. Magnetic north, which is the place that compasses point to, is constantly moving. But the latest changes have been greater than expected. And that's the latest world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是黛比·罗斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。昨晚巴黎一座居民楼发生大火，导致8人死亡，警方认为是有人蓄意纵火。巴黎检察官雷米·赫兹表示该楼里的一名女性现已被拘捕。随着调查的进行，目前阶段的信息显示这是一起犯罪行为。该楼的一名住户现已被逮捕。该嫌疑人在当晚离火灾事发地不远处被捕，现在在监禁中。住户们表示这名女性精神有问题，她曾与邻居消防员因音乐声音过大发生争吵，当时她扬言要烧了这座楼。在这栋位于法国首都以西的8层建筑中，至少有三十人在大火中受伤。\n前阿富汗总统哈米德·卡尔扎伊和有影响力的反对党代表正在莫斯科与塔利班举行政治谈判。上个月，当塔利班与美国官员起草首个和平协议的框架时，希望重新燃起。但是阿富汗政府官员并没有参与到谈判中来，因为塔利班拒绝见他们。以下是赛康德·科芒尼的报道。塔利班拒绝了美国让他们与阿什拉夫·加尼的国家统一政府直接接触的要求，他们称这个政府是不合法的。与会者表示这是塔利班和阿富汗政治掮客开启对话的机会。首都喀布尔的一些人认为这是政治对手来削弱阿富汗政府的一种手段，是他们背后与塔利班进行的探索性交易。\n埃塞俄比亚的国家媒体报道称，在西部地区有200多人被逮捕，原因是他们正在接受非法的军事训练。据报道，埃塞俄比亚军队和警察在苏丹边境终止了他们的训练，当地的民族冲突也导致数万人从家乡逃离。布基纳法索的安全部队表示他们杀死了大量的武装分子，以报复他们在国家北部杀死十四名平民的袭击。军方表示武装分子周日晚袭击了亚滕加省该隐村。一名军方发言人表示布基纳法索军队在三个北方省份实施了大规模的行动，报道称杀死了146名武装分子。\n美国科学家意外地发表了一份他们的地球磁场模型的更新，该模型旨在记录地球磁场北极的加速移动。地磁北极，也就是指南针所指的方向，它正在不断地移动，最近的变化比预期的更快。以上就是最新的BBC新闻。
