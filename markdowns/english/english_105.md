Hello, I'm Marion Marshall with the BBC News. US media reports said the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein has been found dead in his jail cell apparently after killing himself. He was charged last month with trafficking dozens of underage girls for sex and had been due to stand trial next year. He denied the charges. Epstein was once friends with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Britain's Prince Andrew and many other wealthy and influential people. Chris Buckler reports from Washington. Jeffery Epstein was a multimillionaire and a prominent figure in wealthy social circles in the US. He founded and ran his own financial investment company. But a decade ago, he pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges in Florida and there had been controversy surrounding the plea deal he reached then with the US Attorney's office in Miami. In July, he was arrested and charged with further sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage girls. He was being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and three weeks ago, he was found in his cell with what appeared to be self-inflicted marks on his neck. Since then, he had been on suicide watch.\nDemonstrators are holding a large rally in Moscow to demand free elections, the fourth big protest in a month. It has been authorized, but the police are warning protesters not to go ahead with an unapproved march through the city centre afterwards. Our correspondent in Moscow is Sarah Rainsford. Police have warned anyone who intends to take their protests beyond here, these authorized spots, they could be arrested. They could face criminal prosecutions. So there's been a whole series of strict warnings against people heading into the city center with their protests and I think that's because these rallies have really taken the authorities here by surprise. And I think the scale of the the anger generally here is worrying for those in charge in Moscow and right up to the Kremlin.\nSouthern separated forces in Yemen appeared to have made major gains against pro-government soldiers after four days of fighting in Aden, until recently the two forces had been fighting together as part of the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi rebels. More from Sebastian Usher. The separatist fighters have concentrated their attacks on symbols of the government which normally controls Aden as its temporary capital, but still operates at least partly in exile. These include the presidential palace where the president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi is not in residence and the area where the interior minister lives, although he too is not there. The separatists say they've seized military barracks belonging to the presidential guard, some of whom seemed to have surrendered. Civilians are taking cover from mortars and trap now that some have been killed in the fighting. The violence undercuts for government's claims to authority, but also showing the fragility of the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi rebels.
