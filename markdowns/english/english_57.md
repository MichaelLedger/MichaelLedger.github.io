Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News.\nTurkey has responded angrily to President Trump's threat to devastate the country economically if it attacks Kurdish forces in Syria after US troops pull out. But Mr. Trump also asked Kurdish groups who are regarded by Ankara as terrorists not to provoke Turkey. More from Barbara Plett Usher.\nMr. Trump has threatened Turkey with devastating its economy if the Turks attacked these Kurds after the Americans leave and now the Turkish President has responded and he's said, you know, we expect you to behave like a strategic partner. You cannot equate terrorists with partners. In the meantime, Mr. Trump has actually given away a few details about this troop withdrawal. He talked about a twenty-mile safe zone presumably along the border between Turkey and northern Syria. He also said if Islamic State militants come back in Syria, we can always attack them from a nearby military base, responding to criticism that the US is retreating and allowing a situation where Islamic State can regroup.\nIndonesian officials say they have recovered the cockpit voice recorder from a Lion airplane that crashed into the Java Sea in October. Reports say it was found eight meters deep under mud on the seafloor. Officials say human remains were also discovered. Rebecca Henschke reports.\nThe budget airline flight lost contact shortly after takeoff from Jakarta airport and crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 189 people on board. Investigators have said in their early reports that the plane, a nearly brand new Boeing 737 MAX 8 had technical problems.

More details now from Celia Hatton.\nOne of CARE's former employees said the organization had been covering up its real stance on animal euthanasia, charging the CARE CEO Park So-yeon had lied about killing more than two hundred dogs due to the organization's public stance against the practice. Ms. Park reportedly told the charity supporters some of the animals that had actually been killed had instead been adopted in order to encourage donations. CARE has said that a small number of dogs were euthanized, mostly because of illness and had tried its best to respond to what it said was an overwhelming number of requests to save animals.\nBBC world news.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼尔·努内斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n特朗普威胁称，如果土耳其在美国撤军后袭击库尔德武装，就会在经济上摧毁土耳其，土耳其对此作出了愤怒的回应。但特朗普也要求被土耳其视为恐怖分子的库尔德武装不要挑衅土耳其。以下是芭芭拉·普莱特-亚瑟的报道。\n特朗普威胁称如果美国撤军后土耳其袭击库尔德武装，美国将会摧毁其国内经济；土耳其总统回应称我们把你当作战略伙伴，你不能把恐怖分子也当作伙伴。同时，特朗普也给出了一些撤军的详细信息。他谈到可能要在土耳其和叙利亚北部之间建立一个20公里的安全区。他表示如果伊斯兰国组织武装从叙利亚返回，美国可以从附近的军事基地赶来对抗他们，这也是特朗普对美国撤军和任由伊斯兰国组织复苏的批评做出的回应。\n印度尼西亚官方表示他们已经找到了去年10月坠入爪洼海的狮航客机驾驶舱上的语音记录器。报道称，这个记录器在海床下8米深的淤泥中被找到。官员表示他们也找到了遇难者的遗体。以下是蕾贝卡·亨施客的报道。\n该趟廉价航班从雅加达机场起飞后不久失联，并坠入爪洼海，机上189人全部遇难。调查人员在早期报告中称这架近乎全新的波音737 MAX 8飞机存在技术问题。一些遇难人员家属已经对波音公司提起法律诉讼。\n韩国动物营救组织CARE的负责人正面临着辞职的压力，因为有告密者指控她秘密地让员工对数十条流浪犬实施安乐死。以下是西利亚·哈顿的报道。\nCARE的一名前员工称该组织一直都在掩盖对于动物实施安乐死的真实立场，并指控其CEO朴素妍掩盖了杀死200条狗的事实，因为对动物实施安乐死与该组织的公开立场相背。据报道，朴素妍告诉慈善组织支持者们，这些实际上已经被杀的动物都被人领养了，以此鼓励捐赠。CARE表示一小部分狗被安乐死了，大多是因为生病，并且他们已经应人们的要求尽最大努力去拯救动物了。\nBBC国际新闻。
