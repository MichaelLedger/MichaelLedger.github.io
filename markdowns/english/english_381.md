Chandler: Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.\n请问现在为何都用小灯泡？我记得以前都用大灯泡。\nRachel: That's a good story, Grandpa.\n真是个很久远的故事了，爷爷。\nRoss: Hey.\n嘿。\nAll: Hey.\n嘿。\nRoss: Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree? ! Did someone get her drunk again or?\n莫妮卡居然让别人布置她的圣诞树，谁又把她灌醉了吗？\nMonica: Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.\n圣诞节的意义不在于圣诞树，而在于与所爱的人共度。\nPhoebe: That is nice and we're done. tada!\n说得真好，布置好了！\nChandler: I don't know what it is, just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.\n我总觉得它少了一股圣诞味。\nMonica: Oh, here.\n那这样呢。\nChandler: See now it feels like Christmas!\n这样才像圣诞节！\nRoss: …and that's the story of the dreidel.\n……这就是犹太陀螺的由来。\nRoss: Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolizing life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.\n有些人说圣诞树源自古埃及，在每年白昼最短的日子，他们会把棕榈枝带进屋里，象征生命战胜死亡。那是4千年前的事了。\nRachel: So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.\n你开始讲这个故事也差不多是那时候。\nJoey: Hi you guys.\n你们好。\nChandler: Hey Joe, what's up?\n乔伊，怎么了？\nJoey: I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. You know, everywhere I look she's like...\n我不出门不行，吉宁到处做伸展运动一转头就看到她在……\nChandler: I can see why that's hard to resist.\n难怪你无法抗拒。\nJoey: I like her so much!\n我好喜欢她！\nMonica: Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.\n可惜她对你没感觉。\nJoey: I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.\n就是啊，她好可爱。我好想喂她吃葡萄，帮她梳头。\nChandler: You are aware that she's, not a monkey, right?\n你知道她不是猴子吧？\nRoss: I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like old news!\n我已经不在乎吉宁了，我原本觉得她很火辣，现在她已经成了过去式！\nJanine: Hey guys!\n你们好！\nRoss: Janine!\n吉宁！\nJanine: I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dicking Rocking Dickie Eve.\n我刚接到除夕特别节目的通告。叫什么狄克摇滚狄奇之夜的。\nMonica: Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?\n慢着是狄克克拉克新年摇滚之夜吗。\nJanine: Yeah, that's what they said.\n就是那个。\nMonica: Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I've been watching it since I, I can remember!\n天哪，我们爱死那个节目了！从我有记忆以来。罗斯和我每年都看！\nChandler: Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?\n内心深处的你仍是个小胖妹？\nJanine: Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.\n我今年要去当狂欢派对来宾。\nRoss: Wh? you're gonna be a party person? ! Those guys rock the most!\n你要去当派对来宾？那些人最酷了！\nJanine: Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?\n他们叫我带人去。你愿意当我的舞伴吗？\nJoey: Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.\n当然！我很愿意跟你渡过新年。\nJanine: Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.\n明天就要录影了，我也不太懂为什么。\nRoss: Oh, well you see, how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Time Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.\n是这样的，时代广场的部分是现场直播，但他们会预录狂欢派对的画面。知道这一点的人并不多。\nJanine: Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?\n你们也想去吗？\nRoss: Are you serious?\n真的还假的？\nMonica: We are there!\n一言为定！\nChandler: What, what are you laughing at?\n你笑什么笑？\nRachel: Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!\n我跟他交往是过去式了，但你还跟她在一起。\nJanine: Oh thanks. Great! So we can all go together! I I gotta run. Catch you later!\n谢谢……那我们就一起去！我得走了，回头见！\nAll: Bye!\n再见！\nRoss: Bye Janine!\n吉宁再见！\nJoey: Did she just ask me out on a date?\n她是不是约我了？\nChandler: I don't think so.\n应该不是。\nMonica: What what're you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!\n你在说什么？她找他参加千禧年最盛大的晚会耶！\nRachel: Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.\n但她也找了你和罗斯很抱歉，那应该不算约会。\nJoey: Oh. Maybe. But hey, I know how I can find out. Well we're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! You know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'\n或许吧，但我有一个办法。我们不是要参加跨年晚会？到了午夜，我可以亲她。要是她也回吻，太棒！要是她说“你干什么？”我就说“都是新年害的”。\nRachel: Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed a ChapStick.\n比高中时罗斯想亲我的借口要好，他说他需要润唇膏。\nRoss: It was a dry day.\n那天很干燥。\nMonica: We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!\n我们要上狄克克拉克跨年晚会！\nRoss: Oh my God!\n我的天哪！\nMonica: Oh my God!\n我的天哪！\nChandler: Oh my God!\n我的天啊！\nJoey: OK, listen up, I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright?\n听着，我录过影，我有些建议。\nJoey: It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. Important thing you remember stay cool.\n虽然是上电视，我们只管跳舞，没什么大不了的，最重要的是要酷。\nRoss: Got it! Oh my God, it's just like I dreamed it!\n了解！天哪，跟我梦想的一样！\nDirector: OK, everyone, gather up.\n全体集合。\nMonica and Ross:'Scuse us.\n借过。\nDirector: Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?\n我们要做的是音乐一放，你们就跳舞，我们会录影，你们不要看镜头，有问题吗？\nRoss: Uh yeah, I have a question. Uh when is this gonna air?\n我有，什么时候播出？\nDirector: Yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys, over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.\n好，你们去那边跳，你们去那边跳，你们两个在这里，其他人散开。\nMonica: You know what? We'd rather not dance together because…umm. see, we're brother and sister.\n我们最好不要配一对，因为我们是兄妹。\nRoss: Yeah, itit would seem kinda weird.\n对，那样会有点怪。\nDirector: Would it seem as weird as coming all the way down here and then having to go home right now?\n会比大老远跑来，却得立刻滚回家来得怪吗？\nMonica: Yeah.\n好吧。\nJoey: Ross! So when is it gonna air?\n罗斯！所以是什么时候播？\nRachel: Ok, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.\n你找厨房，我找后面的柜子。\nChandler: I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.\n不必浪费时间了，我在这里。\nPhoebe: Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.\n钱德，你出去一下，这件事与你无关。\nRachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.\n我们在找莫妮卡送的圣诞礼物。\nChandler: What? That's terrible!\n什么？太差劲了！\nPhoebe: No no, we do it every year!\n不会，我们每年都找！\nChandler: Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.\n那就不差劲了。\nPhoebe: No, yeah, we never find them! She's always bested us that wily minx.\n但我们没有找到过！她老是打败我们，奸诈的贱人。\nRachel: Yeah, don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?\n放心，我们找1个小时，就会到乔伊那边找，好吗？\nChandler: No, not ok, you can't look for Monica's presents!\n不好，你们不能找她送的礼物！\nPhoebe: But we have to!\n我们一定要找！\nChandler: No, you don't have to, and you can't because I I live here too.\n你们不一定要找，也不能找！因为我也住在这里。\nPhoebe: Well, then, you should look with us.\n那你应该跟我们一起找。\nChandler: Why?\n为什么？\nRachel: Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?\n你都不愁要送莫妮卡什么吗？\nChandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.\n不会，我有个很棒的构想。\nPhoebe: Oh, that's it? A great idea oh yeah.\n就只有很棒的构想？\nRachel: Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents?\n那样是不够的，要是她送你一个大礼，两个普通礼和一堆小礼呢？\nRachel: And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?\n而你只送她一份礼，她一定会很难过，你为什么要让她难过？为什么？为什么？\nChandler: If I help, we can find them faster!\n有我帮忙找得更快！\nRachel: That's right!\n没错！\nPhoebe: Ooh, ooh, we have a live one!\n找到一个了！\nRachel: Oh, it's a Macy's bag!

P.S.Chandler, I knew they'd break you.\n亲爱的失败者，你们真以为我会藏在沙发下？附注：钱德，我就知道你会让步。\nPhoebe: Uh oh. She may be onto us.\n她可能已经发现了。\nRachel: We are so gonna find them this year.\n我们今年一定要找到。\nChandler: You know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?\n你们刚才说会到对面去找，该不会是每年都去吧？\nRachel: Yeah.\n是啊。\nChandler: You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?\n你们没有到我的柜子里面，翻我的健身袋底下吧？\nPhoebe and Rachel: No, we never do that.\n没有，从来没有。\nChandler: Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life!
