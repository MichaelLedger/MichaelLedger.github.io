I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.\n朋友们，今天我要演唱全新的曲目。我写了12首关于我妈自杀的歌及一首有关雪人的歌。\nChandler: You might wanna open with the snowman.\n你最好先唱雪人那首。\nAll: Hey, Joey.

It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?\n当他的一个助手，真是耻辱。\nRachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?\n你们打算如何过新年？\nAll: Oh, no! Rachel: Gee, what? ! What is wrong with New Year's?\n苍天！怎么了？ 过新年有什么不对吗？\nChandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday. Desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops! ! Man, I'm talking loud!\n你当然没事，你有保罗，不用面对新年带来的压力。不用焦虑地见嘴就上，就为了在落球仪式时有个亲吻的对象。天啊，我太焦虑了。\nRachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.\n告诉你吧，这个新年保罗会待在罗马，所以我和各位一样悲哀。\nPhoebe: Yeah, you wish.\n想得美。\nChandler: I got an idea, dinner.\n我倒有一个主意，吃晚餐！\nRoss: It's perfect, we will put it between lunch and breakfast.\n好极了，我们可以把它放在早饭和午饭之间。\nChandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.

Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!\n女士们先生们，应大家要求，我们再次请上菲比·布菲小姐。\nPhoebe: Hi, thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. I made a man with eyes of coal and a smile so bewitching. How was I supposed to know that my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la. My mother's ashes. Even her eyelashes are resting in a little yellow jar. And sometimes when it's breezy...I feel a little sneezy. And now I...Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?\n谢谢大家，我想用一首对我意义重大的歌曲开场。我造了一个人，煤炭做的眼睛，伴着令人着迷的微笑。母亲死在了厨房，这我怎会预料。啦啦啦啦啦啦啦。母亲的骨灰，甚至连同她的睫毛，都安放在一个黄色的小罐中。有时阵阵凉风起，我有点想打喷嚏。然后...喂，等一下，噪音男孩们！ 你们有什么想和大家分享的吗？\nMax: No. No, that's...that's okay.\n没...没事\nPhoebe: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!\n说说吧，如果你们的事情重要到非在我演唱时讨论，我觉得有必要让大家都听听。\nChandler: That guy's going home with a note!\n那家伙看来得带个注意事项回家了。\nDavid: Noth...I was...I was just saying to my\n我只是在告诉我朋友...\nPhoebe: Could you speak up please?\n大声点行吗？\nDavid: Sorry, I wa...I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in...in my life. And then he said that...you said you thought Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life. and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in...in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of hard quality. And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way. You are luminous with a kind of delicate grace. Then that's when you started yelling.\n抱歉，我刚才跟我朋友说你是我见过最漂亮的女子。然后他，他说，他认为黛瑞汉娜是他见过的最漂亮的女子。是，我非常喜欢《美人鱼》里的她，但是在《华尔街》里就不那么出色了，不过她还是很有气质的...黛瑞汉娜是传统的美，而你散发出的是优雅的美。讲到这你就开始冲我们喊了。\nPhoebe: Okay, we're gonna take a short break.\n好吧，我们休息片刻。\nJoey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!\n这把那家伙不止能带个注意事项回家了。\nRoss: Come here, Marcel. Sit here.\n过来，马赛尔，坐这儿。\nRachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! Ooh, Did I just share too much? Ross: Just a smidgen. David's like, y'know, a scientist Guy. He's very methodical.\n菲比，我不敢相信他还没吻过你。我第6次与保罗约会时他就为我双峰取了名字。额，是我分享的太多了吗？ 一点点。大卫毕竟是科学家，做事一板一眼。\nMonica: I think it's romantic.\n我觉得挺浪漫的。\nPhoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see 'An Officer and a Gentleman'? Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except...he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just wanna be with him all the time. You know, day and night, and night and day, and special occasions.\n我也是！你们看过《军官与绅士》吗？我会想和他这样的男人去看这部电影。除了，额，他很聪明、很绅士，还很贴心......我只想整天和他厮守在一起，不管白天还是夜晚，夜晚还是白天，以及一些特殊的节日......\nChandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.\n等等，等等，我知道了，你想邀他共度新年，对不对？你想放我们鸽子，她想放我们鸽子。\nPhoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?\n不不不，不是……好吧，是的，可以吗？\nChandler: Yeah, because I already asked Janice.\n可以，因为我已经约了詹妮丝。\nAll: Oh! What? !\n什么！？\nRoss: Come on, this was a pact! This was your pact!\n这可是个约定！这是你提出的约定！\nChandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.\n我毁约了，行吗？我耐不住寂寞，我掉链子了！\nMonica: Yeah, but Janice? That...that was like the worst breakup in history.\n可那是詹妮丝啊…你们分手时的糟糕情况简直史无前例。\nChandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!\n我没说这是个好主意， 我说我掉链子了。\nJoey: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.\n嗨，不好意思，我来晚了。\nChandler: Too many jokes...must mock Joey.\n实在太滑稽了，快来嘲笑Joey！\nJoey: Nice shoes, huh?\n鞋子正点吧？\nChandler: Aah, you are killing me!\n笑死我算了！\nMonica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!\n罗斯！ 它又在玩我的饭铲。\nRoss: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?\n放松，它又不会把它们玩坏的。\nMonica: Do you always have to bring him here?\n你非要每次都带它来不可吗？\nRoss: Look, I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We...we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he threw some faeces...\n我不想让它独守空房，我们今早才吵了一架。一定是我加班到太晚的原因。 我说了不该说的话，它就朝我扔了些排泄物……\nChandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.\n如果你要加班，我可以替你照顾它。\nRoss: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.\n太好了，不过你要表现出一副你主动照顾它的样子，不要让它觉得你是在帮我的忙。\nChandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.\n好，但它如果问起，我可就要实话实说了。\nDavid:But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.\n但我们仍无法测试这个理论，因为现在的粒子加速器远不能模拟出这些情况。\nPhoebe: Okay, alright, I have a question, then.\n好，我倒有个问题。\nDavid: Yeah?\n什么？\nPhoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?\n你打算过要亲我吗？\nDavid: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. and, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you. Phoebe: Sure. Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... DSweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.\n这是个正当而合理的问题。答案是…是的， 是，我想过。但我要让这种非凡的事情发生在非凡的时刻，因为是你啊。当然。但等得越久，这个吻就需要显得越非凡，而此时此刻，我想，我需要…扫去桌上的一切，将你丢到桌子上，但我不是那种会扫去一切，猴急的男人。\nPhoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella. I mean, you're a sweeper!...trapped inside a physicist's body.\n大卫，我想你是的，你是被困在物理学家体内的猛男。\nDavid: Really?\n真的？\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.\n没错，我敢肯定，行动吧，扫去一切，将我丢上去吧。\nDavid: Now? Now?\n在这？现在？\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, right now.\n对，现在。\nDavid: Okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. and I'll take...this was a gift.\n好的，来吧...不过这东西很贵的，还有这个，是别人送的。\nPhoebe: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.\n额，你这是在清理场地。\nDavid: Okay, okey, what the hell, what the hell.\n好吧，管他呢。\nDavid: You want me to actually throw you or you you wanna just hop?\n你想让我丢你上去还是自己跳上去？\nPhoebe: I can hop.\n我自己跳好了。\nRoss: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?\n告诉我，'没有约会的约定' 对你们的意义何在？\nMonica: Okey, look, I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.\n抱歉，不过钱德勒找了人，菲比也有对象了，所以我决定约搞笑巴比。\nChandler: Fun Bobby?

Joey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk! There! Now there is.\n给你。 太满了，我没法加牛奶了。现在好了。\nRoss: Okay, so on our nodate evening, three of you now are going to have dates.\n所以在这个原本没有约会的晚上，你们三人都另有节目了。\nJoey: Uh, four.\n四个。\nRoss: Four.\n四个...\nRachel: Five.\n是五个。\nRoss: Five.\n五个...\nRachel: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.\n没办法，保罗提早搭飞机回来。\nJoey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?\n而我在商场遇到一个很性感的单身妈妈， 让我这个小精灵怎能抗拒？\nRoss: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?\n这么说大球落下的时候我是唯一的一个孤零零的家伙？\nRachel: Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no one'll know who's with who.\n不会的，到时候我们将开个盛大的派对，没有人知道谁和谁是一对儿。\nRoss: They will all know. Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.\n大家肯定都知道！唉，这可不是我现在需要的情况。\nMonica: What's the matter?\n出什么事了？\nRoss: Oh, it's...it's Marcel. He's angry with me again. I have no idea why, he keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...\n还不是马赛儿，它又生我的气了。我不知道为什么，它一直不让我进门，还拖着手不断绕圈子……\nChandler: That's so weird. I had such a blast with him the other night.\n奇怪，我那天晚上还跟它相处得很愉快。\nRoss: Really. Chandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV...that juggling thing is amazing. What, uh...what juggling thing?\n真的？ 是啊，我们一起玩，一起看电视，它杂耍的时候简直棒极了。什么杂耍？\nChandler: With the balledup socks? I figured you taught him that. Ross: No. Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks...and a melon...\n把袜子团起来当球耍，我以为那是你教它的。 我没有。其实也不算什么，只是拿袜子当球耍罢了...还耍了一颗香瓜。\nMax: Phoebe. Hi.\n你好，菲比。\nPhoebe: Oh, hi Max!
