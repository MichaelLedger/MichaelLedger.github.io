And I had a Tic Tac in my tongue. You didn't even mention it.\n不不不。我不是说那个。好。我说了。我不是二十二岁。我今年二十五岁……零十三个月。但我想，这没有任何影响。我是说，年龄差距那根本就不是个事。总之，我迷上你了。我们第一次接吻我就知道了。我舌头上有一粒口香糖，你连提都没提。\nEthan: I just thought you were naturally minty. Listen...as long as we're telling stuffI have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.\n我只是觉得你身上有一种自然的薄荷香。听着，既然咱们都说开了……我也有话要对你说。我比你知道的年龄还要小那么一点点。\nMonica: You're not a senior?\n你不是毕业班的吗？\nEthan: Oh, I'm a senior... in high school.\n我是毕业班的，高中生。\nMonica: What we did was wrong. Oh God, I just had sex with someone who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.\n我们做错事了。天哪，我刚刚竟和一个在建国两百年国庆时都还没出生的男人做爱了。
