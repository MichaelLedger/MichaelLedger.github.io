I mean, hey, you know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, you know?\n不是因为我还爱着他！我是说，我喜欢罗斯更甚于别的男朋友。\nClearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love!

It's so obvious!\n我们以为你知道，那么明显！\nGod, that would be like you know telling Monica, "Hey, you know, you like things clean." Or, you know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."\n就像告诉莫妮卡 “喂，你很爱干净喔”或是“乔伊，你是同志喔”。\nRachel: What? !\n什么？\nPhoebe: Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!\n拜托，她老是拿着扫把！\nJoey: Hey!\n嗨！\nThe Vendor: So, what are you fine gentlemen in the market for?

Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Huh?\n推迟？埃米莉，你不觉得莫尼卡没有意识到我们的父母已经为这婚礼投入了很多吗？\nDo you think my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.\n你不觉得我妹妹她那个奇小无比的脑子根本就没有意识到大家已经花了时间和金钱飞行数千英里到了这里吗？这可不行。\nEmily: I-I realise that people are gonna be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.\n我知道大家会感到失望的。不过我相信等我们一切就绪了，他们还是会回来的。\nRoss: Well, I can't ask people to do that. Would you ask people to do that?\n我可不能和大家说这事，你愿意去说吗？\nEmily: Don't you point your pants at me!

This is our wedding I'm talking about.\n我们一个月前预定的可不是那幢拆了一半的房子，罗斯你不明白吗？我是在说我们的婚礼！\nRoss: The only thing I understand is: postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.\n反正我认为推迟不是个好主意，无论如何我们就得现在结婚。\nEmily: So what are you saying? It's now or never?\n好吧，你说吧，现在结婚或者再也不结婚？\nRoss: No. I'm saying it's now.\n不，我是说现在结婚。\nEmily: Or?\n或者？\nRoss: There's no 'or' in mine. What is wrong with these pants? !!\n没有"或者"，这裤子到底怎么了？\nEmily: It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!\n不是裤子的问题，是你自己穿反了。如果你意识不到这婚礼对我来说有多重要的话，那也许我们不该结婚！！\nRoss: What, Emily, No, wait! Stop! Emily, please-\n等等，埃米莉，不，等等，别走，埃米莉，求你了？\nPhoebe: Hey!\n嘿！\nRachel: Hi.\n嗨。\nPhoebe: So, did shopping help you feel any better about Ross?\n出去采购让你感觉好些了吗？\nRachel: Manhattan does not have enough stores.\n曼哈顿的店还不够多。\nPhoebe: Well, I think I can help you get over him.\n嗯，也许我能帮你忘记他。\nRachel: You can?\n你行吗？\nPhoebe: Yeah.

Yeah, the pictures are for you, the chocolate and the water is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up so.\n除非你也打嗝。照片是你用的，水和巧克力是给我用的，我只是不想爬起来。\nOk, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Ok? And you're going to remember all the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.\n好了，我现在要你看着罗斯的照片，行吗？然后你就想他所有的坏处。行吗？只要想他的缺点。\nRachel: I can do that. Certainly did it when we were going out.\n当然行，我们俩还在一起的时候我就常干这个。\nPhoebe: Ok. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy.\n那好，对了，在我们开始之前，我必须说其实我觉得他不坏，我很喜欢他。\nPhoebe: Ok, now, close your eyes.

And you're-you're running your hands all over his body.\n好了，现在开始吧，闭上眼睛。想象你和罗斯在一起。然后想象你正在吻他。然后你的手抚遍他的全身。\nAnd then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-yuck! Hah?\n然后你用手梳理他的头发，但是，哎呀，满手都是油，太差劲了不是吗？\nRachel: Well I don't know, I don't know, his uh, his hair never bothered me that much, and you know it was-was always more crunchy than it was greasy.\n我不知道，我从来没有为他的头发烦恼过。我倒是更烦他头发老是悉里索落的响。\nPhoebe: Ok, this is gonna be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.\n那好吧，这比我想象的更难。好吧，让我们试试"厌恶疗法"\nRachel: Ok.\n好吧。\nPhoebe: Ok?\n好？\nRachel: All right.\n开始。\nPhoebe: So uh, yeah, look at the picture...\n现在看着照片。\nRachel: Ok.\n好了。\nPhoebe: All right, and umm...\n然后，嗯......\nRachel: Ow!\n哎呀！\nPhoebe: Ok, how do you feel now?\n好了，现在感觉如何？\nRachel: Well, I like you less!\n我开始不喜欢你了！\nChandler: Well, this is just as boring in England.\n在英国玩也一样难玩。\nJoey: Hey.\n嗨。\nChandler: Hey.\n嗨。\nJoey: Oh.

I really shouldn't've said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool.\n不不不，对不起。真的，我不该说你让我尴尬，我只是说那不够酷。\nAnd if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.\n如果能让你感觉好些的话，我今天过得可没意思了。\nJoey: Me too.\n我也是。\nChandler: Yeah?\n是吗？\nJoey: Noo! !

We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake, with the little people on top.\n我们女孩都是这样的！我们梦想有一个完美的婚礼。和一个完美的地点。和一个完美的四层结婚蛋糕有小人立在上面的那种。\nMonica: But the most important part, is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.\n不过最重要的是我们拥有一个能理解那些东西有多重要的人。\nRoss: I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing The Flying Nun.\n这我可不知道。我记得那白枕套的事情，我还以为你们是在扮"会飞的修女"呢。\nMonica: Sometimes we were.\n有时候是的。\nRoss: Come on.
