She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.\n没事，只是一场误会。她没有要找我去，她只是要告诉我，她要去佛罗里达放春假。\nChandler: Wait a minute, she going for spring vacation or she going for spring break?\n等等，她是去放春假，还是去春游？\nRoss: What's what's the difference?\n有什么差别？\nMonica: Well, spring vacation you're doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.\n春假是跟爷爷奶奶共享天伦，春游是跟兄弟会的人上床。\nRoss: Hey, you know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.\n并非每个人的春游都那样。\nPhoebe: What did you do on yours?\n你做了什么？\nRoss: I went to Egypt with my dad.\n我跟我爸去埃及。\nChandler: I can see it now, ‘Look dad, it's the Sphinx!’\n我可以想像，“看呐爸爸，是狮身人面像！”\nRoss: I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, ‘Spring break!’ All right? I mean come on, she's taken my class!\n伊丽莎白那么正经，不会去“春游”，好吗？她修了我的课！\nMonica: And slept with the professor.\n还跟教授上床。\nRoss: I wanna call her.\n我去打给她。\nRachel: Hey!

See you later!\n好，那就改天见！\nChandler: Turns out he is kinda funny.\n原来他蛮风趣的。\nRachel: I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he just left because of you!\n你们太过份了！他人很好，却被你们赶走了！\nChandler: Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?\n赛巴斯钦耶？那是猫的名字吗？\nPhoebe: Yeah, you know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. You know, Is that the kind of guy you wanna take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, ok I gotta go!"\n你知道我发现什么？他很容易被吓到。你想带这种人参加舞会吗？“赛巴斯钦，要不要跳舞？”“好，我得走了！”\nMonica: All right guys stop it.

Ok, you broke my fridge; ,you owe me 400 bucks!\n菲比，你在这里！你弄坏我的冰箱，欠我4百！\nPhoebe: Ok, sure!\n好吧。\nJoey: Really? !\n真的？\nPhoebe: Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.\n技术上来说你欠我6百，作为我给你前十次试镜出点子的报酬。\nJoey: Call it even?\n那就扯平了？\nPhoebe: Ok.\n好吧。\nChandler: Well there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?\n回来了，伊丽莎白怎么说？\nRoss: Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woohoo. That means, that means wet T shirt contests, guys doing shots off girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...\n她真的是要去德通纳春游，也就是有湿T恤美女选拔赛，男生朝女生身上扔水球，在陌生人身边醒来……\nJoey: Man, she is gonna have a great time!

It is. And you know what, Ross? Here, you like her, she likes you, everything's gonna be fine.\n对不起，这是很严肃的事。你知道吗？你喜欢她，她也喜欢你，不会有事的。\nRoss: You're right. I'm probably just overreacting. So if she is staying at this party hotel on the beach with a huge pool and free drinks with every meal.\n你说得对，我反应过度了。她要住在滨海饭店，有大游泳池，每顿都有免费的饮料。\nJoey: Well, if she's got enough money for that, she can certainly pay for the fridge she broke.\n她既然这么有钱，一定能赔偿她弄坏的冰箱。\nRoss: I'm so glad you're going on this trip!\n你能去旅行真是好事。\nElizabeth: Yeah!
