This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm Jonathan Izard. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied west bank if he is re-elected in the general election on Tuesday. In a television interview, he said discussions were in hand to extend sovereignty to all settlements. I'm going to extend Israeli sovereignty and I don't make a distinction between blocks of settlements and more isolated settlements. In my opinion, each block is an Israeli area and is under Israeli control. We, the Israeli government have responsibility over these areas. I won't hand them over to the Palestinian authority. The chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel would continue its brazen violation of international law, so long as the world community continued to reward it with impunity. Decades of settlement building deemed illegal by the international community is a huge stumbling block to reaching a peace deal.\nTens of thousands of Venezuelans have taken to the streets in the latest protest against President Nicolas Maduro. The opposition leader Juan Guaido who claims he is the legitimate interim president urged the crowds in Caracas to step up their campaign for change. Will Grant reports. The trembling in the presidential palace because we're in the streets Juan Guaido told thousands of his supporters who turned out in protest at the worsening crisis. Venezuela isn't afraid, he said. Only a small group is in reference to President Nicolas Maduro's inner circle. Some are struggling to find the energy to keep protesting, though, as they have to deal with the daily hardships of electricity and water shortages. For every anti-government march, there is a pro-government one. At a large rally outside the presidential palace Miraflores, President Maduro again blamed the lack of public services on unspecified terrorist attacks aimed at demoralizing and disappointing the Venezuelan people.

They have also started collecting names for a petition demanding that local authorities expropriate properties from private landlords who own more than three thousand flats. Berliners enjoyed cheap rents after reunification, but some estimates say housing costs there have doubled over the past ten years.\nPassenger aircraft have begun flying in and out of a giant new airport in the Turkish city of Istanbul, which Turkey plans to make the biggest in the world. On Saturday, the national carrier Turkish Airlines dispatched its first flight from the airport and eight-billion-dollar project championed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
