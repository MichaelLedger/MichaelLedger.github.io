BBC News. Hello, I'm Jerry Smit.\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry says Russia has handed back three Ukrainian ships that it seized a year ago of Crimea, the Ukrainian territory Moscow annexed in 2014. Jonah Fisher reports.\nThis is another confidence-building measure in the slowly improving relationship between Russia and Ukraine. Two months ago, the 24 sailors who were on board these three ships were returned to Kiev. Now, with the meeting between the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia confirmed for three weeks' time, the ships have been sent back to. Their return will come as a welcome boost for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. He's been criticized for the concessions he's made to try and get peace talks with Russia started.\nNorth Korea has said it's not interested in holding what it described as another fruitless summit with the United States. Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that the North Korean leader should act quickly to negotiate a nuclear deal with the US. This report from Seoul by Laura Bicker.\nNorth Korean state media claims that Pyongyang has not received a fair price for giving President Trump a summit with Kim Jong-un. It described the previous meetings between the two leaders as fruitless and claimed the talks had allowed President Trump to boast about his achievements. This statement warned Washington that North Korea will only enter into talks if the US drops its hostile policies, which may mean Pyongyang wants sanctions relief before it's willing to come to the negotiating table.\nThe Catalan leader Quim Torra has gone on trial in Barcelona in connection with the yellow ribbons and other separatist symbols on public buildings displayed before Spain's general election in April. He's accused of ignoring a court order to remove them and a banner outside the Catalan administration's headquarters calling for the release of alleged political prisoners.\nA new report from the United Nations says more than seven million children worldwide are being held in detention. The global study on children deprived of their liberty argues that detaining children can be seen as a form of violence. Imogen Foulkes is our correspondent in Geneva.\nWhat the UN is saying is that in the countries where children are detained, because they are problematic, for example, because they have alcohol problems or drug problems or they've committed some crime; that still custodial sentences should be a measure of complete last resort and that there are nearly always better solutions in a family setting. And they point out that all evidence shows that a family setting for children with problems is a much better thing for their future health and development than putting them into custody.\nBBC news.\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻。大家好，我是杰瑞·施密特。\n俄罗斯外交部表示，俄罗斯归还了三艘一年前从克里米亚扣押的乌克兰船只，而克里米亚是2014年被莫斯科吞并的乌克兰领土。请听乔纳·菲舍的报道。\n这是又一个在俄罗斯和乌克兰之间建立信任的措施，两国关系正缓慢改善。两个月前，这三艘船上的24名船员被送回基辅。现在，随着乌克兰和俄罗斯总统之间的会晤已经确认了三周时间，船只也已经被送回。船只的回归对乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基来说是一个可喜的鼓舞。他曾因与俄罗斯开启和平谈判做出让步而受到过批评。\n朝鲜表示对与美国举行另一次毫无结果的峰会不感兴趣。唐纳德·特朗普周日在推特上表示，朝鲜领导人应迅速采取行动，与美国就核协议进行谈判。请听劳拉·比克在首尔的报道。\n朝鲜官方媒体称，平壤方面没有收到合理的条件，因此金正恩不会与特朗普举行峰会。朝鲜官方媒体表示两国领导人之前的会晤毫无结果，并声称会谈让特朗普总统得以吹嘘自己的成就。这份声明警告华盛顿方面，朝鲜只有在美国放弃其敌对政策的情况下才会加入谈判，这可能意味着平壤方面希望先解除制裁，然后才愿意坐到谈判桌前。\n加泰罗尼亚领导人奎姆·托拉已在巴塞罗那接受审判，原因是他与4月份西班牙大选前在公共建筑上悬挂黄丝带和其他与分裂有关的象征物。他被指控无视法院将其移除的命令，另外加泰罗尼亚政府总部外要求释放政治犯的横幅仍然存在。\n联合国的一份新报告称，全世界有700多万儿童被拘留。关于儿童被剥夺自由的全球研究认为，拘留儿童可以被视为一种暴力形式。以下是本台记者伊莫金·福克斯在日内瓦的报道。\n联合国表示，有一些国家会拘留问题儿童，例如，他们有酒精或毒品上瘾问题，或者是他们犯了某种罪。监禁判决仍然应该作为一种不得已的手段执行，而且在家庭环境解决中会是更好的办法。他们指出，所有的证据都表明，对问题儿童来说，家庭环境相比拘留所对他们未来的健康和发展要好的多。\nBBC新闻。
