North-eastern Nigeria is littered with thousands of landmines and improvised explosives after almost a decade of conflict in the region. The Islamist group Boko Haram continues to attack towns and villages and to kidnap hundreds of school girls, most notoriously from the town of Chibok in 2014. The number of people being killed and injured by mines and explosives in Nigeria has greatly increased according to research by the Mines Advisory Group (MAG). Over 160 killed in the past two years, with hundreds more injured. It's had a devastating impact on the region and prevents large areas of land from being farmed, and it's a familiar pattern across the globe.\nSo how many landmines are there around the world? Minefields are often the deadly remnants of war left behind long after the combatants have gone. Under international law when mines are laid they must be mapped so they can be removed safely at a later date. All too often they're not mapped or maps are lost and process of de-mining can be a slow and dangerous one. In 2016, post-conflict clearance operations undertaken by charities such as the Halo Trust destroyed over 200,000 anti-personnel and 20,000 anti-vehicle mines around the world. But this hardly scratches the surface of the problem. There are still an estimated 110 million anti-personnel mines still in the ground with more being laid every year in active conflict areas. In a single year as many as 8,000 people are killed or seriously injured many of them children. That's almost one person killed or injured every hour of every day. That figure has risen as a result of the widespread use of improvised explosive devices by non-government forces.\nBBC news.\n![](images/landmines.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\n在尼日利亚东北部地区冲突停止几乎10年后，其地下仍然埋着上千的地雷和简易爆炸装置。而布下这些地雷和爆炸装置的伊斯兰组织“博科圣地”现在仍然在袭击城镇和乡村，并且因在2014年绑架了奇博克上百名学校女生而臭名远扬。根据地雷顾问团的调查，在尼日利亚，因为地雷和爆炸丧命和受伤的人数有了大幅的增长。在过去两年，尼日利亚超过160人因为地雷丧命，还有上百人因此受伤。地雷给尼日利亚东北部地区带来了灾难性的冲击，大面积地区受此影响不能耕种，全世界其他地区也都是类似的模式。\n那么在全世界地下埋着多少地雷？布雷区在参战方离开很久后，经常还是致命的战争遗留物。根据国际法，地雷在被布下后，必须在地图上标注，这样它们过后可以被安全移除。但是经常是，它们没有被标注或者地图遗失了，因此排雷的过程变得非常缓慢和危险。在2016年，像哈洛信托这样的慈善组织在后冲突地区进行了排雷行动，共摧毁全世界范围内的超过20万杀伤人员地雷和2万反载具地雷。但是这几乎没有解决问题。据估计，全世界的地下仍然埋着1.1亿杀伤人员地雷，并且在活跃的冲突地区每年还会布放新的地雷。单单一年，就有8000人因为地雷丧命或严重受伤，很多是儿童。这几乎相当于每天每小时就有一人因为地雷丧命或者受伤。这个数字还在增长，因为非政府武装力量现在广泛使用简易爆炸装置。
