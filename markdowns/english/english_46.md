Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC news.\nA Chinese robotic probe has become the first spacecraft to land on the far side of the moon. State media in Beijing have confirmed within the last hour that the Chang'e-4 probe had touched down successfully. John Southworth is in Beijing.\nIt marks a milestone in space exploration.

The experiments on board are expected to offer important insights into the formation of our solar system.\nDeadlock continues in Washington after discussions between President Trump and leaders of Congress failed to resolve the budget dispute that's caused the partial government shutdown.
