BBC News. Hello, I'm Gareth Barlow.\nSenators in the United States, including high-profile Republicans, have condemned President Trump's announcement that he's withdrawing American forces from Syria. Six senators led by the Republican Lindsey Graham have written to Mr. Trump, accusing him of making a costly mistake that threatened US security.\nEarlier, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said the move was completely unexpected. We've got allies around the world that have been with us all this time, have been fighting with us. There's probably fifty or sixty countries that have been involved in some form of fashion. To my knowledge, we didn't even communicate with them that this morning we were gonna make this announcement. It's caught everybody off guard. I know that, I doubt there's anybody in the Republican Caucus in the Senate that just isn't stunned.\nBritain, a major ally of the US has expressed concern and questioned Mr. Trump's assertion that Islamic State militants in Syria had been defeated. The British Defense Minister Tobias Ellwood said that on the contrary, the threat from IS was very much alive.\nJapanese government sources say the country has decided to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission in order to resume whaling on a commercial basis. The BBC's Cat Wiener has more details.\nIn September, Japan launched a controversial bid to ease the moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the IWC more than thirty years ago. But its argument that whale stocks has recovered sufficiently to justify the resumption of sustainable hunting was voted down. That seems to have paved the way for this decision. According to the Kyoto News Agency, Tokyo would only allow whaling in the seas around Japan and not stray into Antarctic waters.\nMeanwhile, a court in Japan has rejected a request by prosecutors to extend the detention of Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan who was sacked for alleged financial misconduct. The ruling means he could soon be released. With the details, Steve Jackson reports.\nCarlos Ghosn was first detained on the nineteenth of November when his private jet landed in Tokyo. The 64-year-old French-Brazilian was one of the world's most powerful auto industry executives, but has spent the past month in prison. During that time, he's been charged with lying about his pay for several years. He's accused of hiding eighty million dollars of income and of misusing company funds. He denies all the allegations. The timing of his release is unclear, but Japanese media say it could happen as soon as Friday. The court also rejected an extension to the detention of Greg Kelly, an aide to Mr. Ghosn.\nWorld news from the BBC.\n![](images/withdraw-forces-from-syria.jpg)\n**参考译文：**\nBBC新闻，大家好，我是加雷斯·巴罗。\n包括知名共和党人在内的美国议员对特朗普宣布从叙利亚撤军进行了谴责。以共和党人林赛·格雷厄姆为首的六名议员致信特朗普，指责他犯了一个代价高昂的错误，威胁到了美国的安全。\n早前，参议院外交关系委员会主席鲍勃·考克尔曾表示此举完全出人意料。一直以来，我们的盟友遍布世界各地。他们一直与我们并肩战斗。美国在全世界大约有50到60个这样的盟国。据我所知，我们甚至没有和他们沟通过，他们不知道今晨我们会做出这样的决定。这让每个人都措手不及，我知道，恐怕参议院共和党核心小组内没人不对此感到震惊。\n作为美国的一个重要盟友，英国也对此表示关切，并质疑了特朗普关于叙利亚境内伊斯兰国军事力量已被击败的声明。英国国防部长托比亚斯·埃尔伍德表示，与特朗普所言相反，伊斯兰国组织的威胁依旧很大。\n日本政府消息称日本已决定退出国际捕鲸协会，以恢复商业捕鲸业。以下是BBC记者卡特·温纳的详细报道。\n九月，日本发起了一项具有争议的恢复商业捕鲸提议，要求解除30多年前IWC强制实行的商业捕鲸禁令。日本辩称鲸鱼的数量现已充分恢复可以重新开始持续捕鲸，但遭到否决。这似乎给日本恢复捕鲸的决定铺平了道路。京都新闻社报道称，日本将只允许在日本周边海域捕鲸，并不进入大西洋海域。\n同时，日本一法庭拒绝了检方要求延长日产前董事长卡洛斯·戈恩羁押期的要求，不久前卡洛斯因所谓的财政不当行为遭解雇。法庭的裁定意味着他可能在不久之后会被释放。以下是史蒂夫·杰克森的详细报道。\n卡洛斯·戈恩首次在11月19日被拘押，当时他的私人飞机落地东京。这名64岁的法裔巴西人曾是世界上最强汽车企业高管之一，但是过去半个月却在狱中度过。在此期间，他被指控在多年的薪资问题上说谎。他被指控隐报了八千万美元的收入并挪用了公司的资金。他否认了所有指控。他的释放日期尚不清楚，但是日本媒体称最早周五就会被释放。该法庭也拒绝延长戈恩助手格蕾格·凯利的羁押期。\nBBC国际新闻。
