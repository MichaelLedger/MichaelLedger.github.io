Hello, I'm Ally McHugh with the BBC News. The electoral commission in the Democratic Republic of Congo says it's delaying Sunday's presidential election in three cities until March due to insecurity and an outbreak of the Ebola virus. The decision in effect cancels the vote in Beni and Butembo in North Kivu province and Yumbi in the west of the country because the new president is due to be sworn in by the middle of January. Here's Will Ross. The Congolese electoral commission says it's taken this decision to save lives. There'll be no voting until March in Beni and Butembo in the east of the country because it says there would be a risk the Ebola virus could spread if people travel to the polling stations. A statement also said any election there would provide an opportunity for armed groups to carry out attacks. The timing of this announcement is surprising, considering the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo began in August, and the numerous rebel groups have been active there for years. Perhaps less surprising is the decision to delay the vote in Yumbi in the west, where more than one hundred people were killed in ethnic clashes earlier this month.\nA UN-led ceasefire monitoring team is reported to have met for the first time in the Yemeni port of Hodeida. Details of what was discussed are yet to emerge. The team is expected to work to secure a shaky truce in the city. Alan Johnston has the details. The monitoring team is being headed by a UN-appointed retired Dutch general, and it includes representatives of both the government and the rebels. The two sides recently agreed to a truce in Hodeida, but sporadic fighting has continued. Now the ceasefire monitoring committee is reported to have held its first meeting. Its efforts to make the truce work will be hugely important. Hodeida is a key link in the effort to ship food aid into Yemen where millions of people are threatened by starvation.\nReports from Italy say ten people have been injured following an earthquake in the area around Mount Etna in Sicily, the most active volcano in Europe. James Reynolds has this report. The earthquake hit the slopes of Mount Etna at around twenty past three in the morning. It damaged nearby homes and buildings. In the village of Fleri, an eighty-year-old man had to be rescued from his home. Some decided to take shelter in their cars or in local gyms, anywhere just to be safe. In recent days, scientists recorded more than a hundred tremors, causing the authorities to restrict flights to the regional airports in the city of Catania. James Reynolds reporting. This is the world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是艾琳·麦克尤，欢迎收听BBC新闻。刚果民主共和国的选举委员会宣布，将原定于周日在三个城市举行的大选推迟到3月，原因是不安全因素以及埃博拉病毒的爆发。该决定实际上取消了在贝尼、北基伍省的布滕博以及西部的永比地区的选举活动，因为新总统将会在一月中旬宣誓就职。以下是威尔·罗斯的报道。刚果选举委员会表示采取该措施是为了挽救生命。三月份之前贝尼，以及东部城市布滕博不会举行选举，因为他们担心人们前往投票站会有传播埃博拉的风险。一份声明也表示该地区的选举活动将会给武装分子发动袭击提供机会。该决定宣布的时机令人意外，因为埃博拉病毒8月份就在刚果东部爆发了，另外多个反叛组织已经在该地区活跃了多年。在西部的永比地区推迟选举就没有那么令人意外，因为本月初这里有一百多人在种族冲突中被杀。\n据报道，一个联合国主导的停火监督小组已经在也门港口城市荷台达举行了首次会议。会议讨论的细节尚未公布。该小组有望保证荷台达脆弱的停火协议继续维持，以下是艾伦·约翰斯顿的报道。该监督小组由联合国任命的荷兰退休将军带领，包括政府和反对派双方的代表。双方近期同意在荷台达停火，但是仍有零星的战斗爆发。现在，据报道停火监督委员会已经举行了第一次会议。他们为停火做出的努力将会至关重要。荷台达是将救援食物送往也门地区的关键节点，在也门有数百万人正受到饥饿的威胁。\n意大利的报道称有10人在西西里岛埃特纳火山附近的地震中受伤，该火山也是欧洲最活跃的火山。以下是詹姆斯·雷诺兹的报道。该地震在早上3:20袭击了埃特纳火山的山坡，导致附近的居民房屋建筑受损。在弗莱里村，一名80岁当地老人现已从家中被救出。一些人决定去车中或者是当地的体育馆等安全的地方避难。最近几天以来，科学家记录到了100多次地震，导致政府限制了飞往卡特尼亚市机场的航班。以上是詹姆斯·雷诺兹的报道。BBC国际新闻。
