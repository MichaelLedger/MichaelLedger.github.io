I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35. which gives me five years. So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.

Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.\n我到33岁再结婚就好。我还有3年。不过，等一下。我需要一年半来筹备婚礼。我希望能认识这个人一年至一年半再订婚。这表示我必须在30岁时认识这个人。\nRoss: Which is fine!
