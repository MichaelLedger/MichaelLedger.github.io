Hello, I'm Debbie Russ with the BBC News. Nigerians will soon begin casting their ballots in presidential and parliamentary elections that were postponed, excuse me last Saturday with only a few hours' notice. The main candidates are President Muhammadu Buhari and a former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. Purgle King reports. This is the biggest election in African history with eighty-four million registered voters spread across the continent's most populous nation. Logistical difficulties that cause the postponement of the polls now seem to have been overcome with the National Election Commission assuring voters across the country they would be able to vote. There are still problems not least in the northeast where nearly two million people are displaced and the Boko Haram group and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa have threatened to attack voters. President Muhammadu Buhari has said the police will deal firmly with anybody trying to disrupt the poll.\nThe Venezuelan has shut part of the border with Colombia, complaining of serious threats against its sovereignty. The closure was announced as President Nicolas Maduro's opponents made final preparations to move aid, much of it from the United States across the frontier. From Caracas, here's Katy Watson. This is the day Venezuela's opposition has been waiting for, a day that will test the loyalty of the country's armed forces towards Nicolas Maduro and determine his future. Lorries laden with aid are expected to set off from both Columbia and Brazil and attempt to cross the border. Throughout Vnezuela, people will gather military barracks to ask soldiers for their help in the aid effort. Until now, senior officers have remained loyal to Mr. Maduro, but with pressure being heaped on them to help the Venezuelan people, will they listen to their leader or change sides support Juan Guaido and open the borders?\nThe British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing open divisions within her cabinet over Brexit with a deadline for withdrawal from the EU just over a month away. Three senior ministers have defied government policy to warn that Brexit should be delayed if Parliament fails to approve a deal within days. Here is Nick Baldelli. It is no secret Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark have significant concerns about the prospect of there being no deal, but their latest intervention is significant. The government has yet to confirm whether a new deal will even be put to MPs next week, but this intervention adds to the pressure on the Prime Minister to get assurances from Brussels eminently. It is also a warning to Tory Brexiteers that if they do not back a tweaked version of the Prime Minister's deal, Brexit will be delayed and it will be their fault. That's the latest world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是黛比·罗斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻尼日利亚不久后将开始总统和国会选举，上周日，官方提前几个小时发布通知推迟了该选举。主要的候选人包括总统穆罕马杜·布哈里和前副总统阿提库·阿布巴卡。以下是普格尔·金的报道。这是非洲历史上最大的一次选举，在这个非洲人口最多的国家里，将会有8400万人注册为选民。导致选举推迟的后勤问题现在似乎已经解决，国家选举委员会向选民承诺他们将能够顺利投票。现在仍有一些问题需要处理，在东北地区有近200万人无家可归，博科圣地组织以及其分支伊斯兰国西非威胁称将会袭击选民。总统穆罕马杜·布哈里表示警方将会坚决打击任何想要破坏选举的人。\n委内瑞拉已经关闭了与哥伦比亚的部分边境，称对其主权造成了严重威胁。总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗宣布关闭边境，而反对党也已为转移救援物资做了最后的准备，这些物资大部分都是美国运到前线的。以下是凯蒂·华生在加拉加斯的报道。这一天是委内瑞拉反对党所期待的，这一天也将会检验委内瑞拉武装部队对尼古拉斯·马杜罗的忠诚度，并决定他的未来。装满救援物质的卡车预计将会从哥伦比亚和巴西出发，并尝试穿过边境。委内瑞拉全国上下的人民将会在集结在军事营地，请求士兵们帮助运送物资。直到现在，军方高级官员仍忠诚于马杜罗，但是外界让他们帮助委内瑞拉人民的压力也越来越大，他们会听从其领导人还是倒戈支持胡安·瓜伊多开放边境呢？\n英国首相特蕾莎·梅的内阁对还有一月就到最后期限的脱欧进程产生了分歧。政府的政策警告称如果国会不能在几天内通过一份方案，脱欧应该推迟。三名高级部长表示反对。以下是尼克·贝德利的报道。很明显，安伯·拉德，大卫·高克和格雷格·卡拉克非常担心没有脱欧协议，但是他们最近的干预取得了成效。政府还没有确认是否需要将新的协议在下周向议员提出，但是他们的干预也给首相从欧盟得到保证增加了很大的压力。这也是对托尼派脱欧人士的警告，如果他们不能接受修改版的首相脱欧协议，脱欧进程将会推迟，而且还会归咎到他们身上。以上就是最新的BBC国际新闻。
