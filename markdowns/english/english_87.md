Hello, I'm Rosemary Crick with the BBC News. South Korea has confirmed that large-scale annual military exercises with the United States are to end. The war games which have always infuriated North Korea will be replaced with smaller-scale drills. Steve Jackson reports. For decades, the United States and South Korea have held joint military exercises, which have always triggered an irate response from the North. At one time, the biggest of these drills, known as Foal Eagle, involved almost a quarter of a million soldiers. Pyongyang accused its enemies of planning for an invasion. After President Trump's first summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un last year, some exercises were suspended. But now in spite of the failure of their second summit last week, the biggest of the military drills are to end. Future maneuvers will be on a small scale to avoid inflaming tensions with North Korea.\nA month after the deadly collapse of a dam in Brazil, the head of the mining company responsible has resigned. Fabio Schvartsmant had little choice after federal prosecutors recommended that he and several other senior executives of the mining giant Vale be removed. More than three hundred people died when the dam burst and a vast area was engulfed in toxic mud. Employees arrested as part of an official investigation said the company knew that the structure of the dam was compromised.\nThe Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido who is in Ecuador has called for new protests against the government of Nicolas Maduro on Monday and Tuesday. Mr. Guaido, the self-declared interim president of Venezuela said he would return home to take part although he faces the prospect of arrest. He defied a Supreme Court travel ban by crossing into Colombia a week ago to help coordinate foreign aid deliveries which Mr. Maduro rejected as part of a US-led plot to affect regime change.\nPolice in Mexico say gunmen have killed four people and injured ten others at a birthday party in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas. Witnesses described five or six people with rifles who arrived in a van and opened fire at the party in a function room.\nAustralia has criticized foreign companies involved in an oil spill that threatens the world's largest raised coral atoll in the Solomon Islands. It said there was a lack of action to limit the damage. From Sydney, Phil Mercer reports. At least seventy five tons of heavy fuel oil have spilled from the Solomon trader, a freighter registered in Hong Kong. It was driven into a reef in the Solomon Islands by a tropical cyclone in early February. Australia says the companies involved, including an Indonesian mining firm aren't doing enough to stop about six hundred tons of oil still on board the stricken ship from leaking. Rennell island is home to many species that are found nowhere else.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是罗斯玛丽·克里克，欢迎收听BBC新闻。韩国已经确定与美国的大型年度联合军演将会终结。军事演习一直以来都会激怒朝鲜，现在已经被替换成了小型的军演。以下是史蒂夫·杰克逊的报道。数十年以来，美国和朝鲜都会举行联合军演，而这一般都会引起朝鲜激烈的反应。美韩曾经举行过最大的一次军事演习，代号“鹞鹰”，大约有25万士兵参加。平壤当局曾指控他们的敌人正在计划入侵。自从特朗普和朝鲜最高领导人金正恩去年举行首次峰会之后，一些军事行动就被暂停了。尽管上周举行的第二次峰会以失败告终，但是最大的规模的军事演习还是取消了。未来的军事行动规模将会更小，以避免与朝鲜发生冲突。\n巴西水坝坍塌事故发生一个月之后，涉事的采矿公司的CEO现已辞职。法比欧·施瓦茨曼除了辞职之外别无选择，因为联邦检察员建议他和采矿巨头清水河谷的几名其他高管应该被免职。当大坝被冲开后，大面积区域被有毒的泥浆所吞噬，有超过300人遇难。在正式调查中被捕的公司雇员表示公司知道大坝的结构存在问题。\n委内瑞拉反对党领导人胡安·瓜伊多现正在厄瓜多尔，他呼吁在周一和周二举行新的抗议活动反对尼古拉斯·马杜罗的政府。瓜伊多自称为委内瑞拉的临时总统，他表示尽管有被捕的风险，他也将会回国参加这次抗议活动。他违反了最高法院的旅行禁令，一周前他穿越哥伦比亚边境协助运输国外救援物资，而马杜罗拒绝接受这些物资并称其为美国领导的企图推翻其政权的阴谋。\n墨西哥警方表示枪手在东北部的塔毛利帕斯州一个生日聚会上杀害了四人并导致了十多人受伤。目击者表示有五六个人乘坐面包车而来，手里拿着步枪，在客厅中向派对中的人开火。\n澳大利亚批评导致石油泄漏的涉事公司威胁到了所罗门群岛的上升珊瑚环礁。澳大利亚表示他们未采取措施来降低危害。以下是菲尔·默塞尔在悉尼的报道。至少有75吨的重燃油从一艘香港注册的所罗门商船上泄漏。2月初，该商船在在热带气旋带作用下在所罗门群岛触礁。澳大利亚表示涉事的公司包括一家印尼采矿公司，它没有采取足够的措施阻止船上约600吨的原油继续泄漏。伦内尔岛上有很多世界上独有的物种。
