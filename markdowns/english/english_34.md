Hello, I'm Neil Nunes with the BBC News.\nThe Iranian President has told Parliament his country has missed an opportunity to exploit the United States international isolation. Hassan Rouhani spoke as he presented a forty-seven-billion-dollar budget, the first such measure since the reintroduction of US sanctions on Iran. Shihab Mosbut has this report.\nIn a rowdy and often interrupted address, President Hassan Rouhani said corruption and nepotism at the highest levels of society meant Iran had failed to take advantage of American isolationism. He said the reform with banking, tax and economic infrastructure were essential before Iran could advance its cause internationally. Iran, he said, must harness the strength of its oil industry to counter America sanctions.\nThe British government has confirmed that a British-Iranian academic who has spent eight months in jail in Iran has been released. Abbas Edalat, who is a professor of computer science and mathematics, has returned to the UK. He was arrested by Iran's revolutionary guards in Tehran in April. An Iranian news agency alleged at the time that he was a British spy.\nPresident Erdogan of Turkey has invited Donald Trump to visit next year as the two men attempt to coordinate a pullout of US troops from Syria. Key Middle Eastern powers are seeking to capitalize on America's withdrawal from Syria. Sebastian Usher assesses the situation on the ground.\nThe Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is biding his time, but remains clear in his determination to force Kurdish militias out of Northern Syria. On the ground, militias once united and rebellion now ally to Turkey are reported to have deployed closer to the town of Manbij, while more Turkish troops have moved to the Syrian border in recent days. US soldiers are still in Manbij for now in support of a Kurdish-led alliance they've backed in the battle against IS. The Kurdish fighters were meant to have withdrawn under a deal agreed between the US and Turkey but have yet to leave. President Erdogan says he won't strike against them until the US pulls out.\nTrade unions and professional associations in Sudan have called for a general strike today to demand the resignation of President al-Bashir and the formation of a transitional government. They are planning a march to the presidential palace in Khartoum. Doctors went on strike on Monday as part of the protests sparked last week by anger about the rising price of bread and fuel. On Monday, President Bashir promised what he called real reforms to improve the quality of life of the Sudanese people.\nThis is the world news from the BBC.\n**参考译文：**\n大家好，我是尼尔·努内斯，欢迎收听BBC新闻。\n伊朗总统告诉国会，伊朗错过了利用美国国际孤立政策的机会。哈桑·鲁哈尼发表讲话的同时提交了一份470亿美元的预算，这是美国重新对伊朗实施制裁之后伊朗发布的首项措施。以下是什哈卜·莫斯巴特的报道。\n在环境喧闹并多次被打断的讲话中，哈桑·鲁哈尼总统表示社会最高层的腐败和裙带关系表明伊朗没能利用好美国的孤立政策。他表示在伊朗向国际化推进之前，对银行、税收和经济结构进行改革是必要的。他还表示伊朗必须要利用其石油产业的优势以对抗美国的制裁。\n英国政府已确认一名在伊朗监狱中度过8个月的英国籍伊朗学者现已被释放。阿巴斯·艾德勒是一名计算机科学和数学教授，他现在已经返回英国。他于四月在德黑兰被伊朗革命卫队逮捕。当时一家伊朗新闻机构称他是一名英国间谍。\n土耳其总统埃尔多安邀请了特朗普明年来访，两人计划共同协调美国从叙利亚撤军相关事宜。中东地区的主要力量都寻求利用美国从叙利亚撤军这一机会。以下是塞巴斯汀·厄舍对该事件的实地报道。\n土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安正在耐心等待，但是对于将库尔德武装赶出叙利亚北部的决心十分明确。在当地，据报道之前联合起来的民兵组织以及现在和土耳其结盟的反对派武装都在向曼比杰靠近，而近些天以来也有更多的土耳其军队向叙利亚边境移动。美国士兵仍在曼比杰支持库尔德领导的武装联盟，在与IS的战斗他们支持该武装联盟。库尔德武装本应该按照美国和土耳其的协议从该地区撤出，但仍未离开。埃尔多安总统表示在美国撤军之前不会向他们开火。\n苏丹工会和专业协会今天号召民众举行了一次大罢工，以要求巴希尔总统辞职并组建过渡政府。他们计划在位于喀土穆的总统官邸游行。上周因面包和燃料价格上涨引发了愤怒的游行活动，周一医生们也加入到了罢工中来。周一，总统巴希尔承诺将进行所谓的实质性改革以改善苏丹人民的生活质量。\nBBC国际新闻。
