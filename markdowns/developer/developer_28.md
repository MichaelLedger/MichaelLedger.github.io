```
Q: Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (Preview) what does preview mean?

A: Let me clarify something - I am Claude 3.5 Sonnet, not 3.7. I aim to be direct and honest about my identity.

As for the term "Preview" in AI model names, it typically indicates that the model or feature is in an early access or testing phase before full release. It means the model is being made available to select users to gather feedback and potentially identify issues before a wider rollout.

However, since I'm not aware of a Claude 3.7 model, I can't make specific claims about what that preview designation would mean in that context. I aim to stick to facts I'm confident about rather than speculate.

```

If you are a member of an organization that has upgraded to a GitHub Copilot Pro account, 

**open github copilot chat in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl+Cmd+I` and switch ai model as `Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking`**.

Task:
how to use GitHub MCP Server command search_repositories

‚òëÔ∏è Task Completed
I'll demonstrate how to use the search_repositories tool from the GitHub MCP server with some practical examples.

The search_repositories tool requires a query parameter and has optional parameters for pagination. From the input schema:

query: The search query (required)
page: Page number (optional, default 1)
perPage: Results per page (optional, default 30, max 100)

Cline wants to use a tool on the GitHub MCP server
...

Basic Structure:
{
  "query": "search query",    // Required
  "page": number,            // Optional (default: 1)
  "perPage": number         // Optional (default: 30, max: 100)
}

Key Search Qualifiers:
language: - Filter by programming language (e.g., language:swift)
stars:>n - Filter by number of stars (e.g., stars:>1000)
license: - Filter by license type (e.g., license:mit)
topic: - Filter by repository topic (e.g., topic:swiftui)
created: - Filter by creation date (e.g., created:>2024-01-01)
sort: - Sort results (e.g., sort:stars, sort:updated)

Example Queries:

Popular Swift repositories:
{"query": "language:swift stars:>1000 sort:stars"}

MIT-licensed iOS templates:
{"query": "ios-app-template license:mit language:swift"}

Recent SwiftUI projects:
{"query": "topic:swiftui created:>2024-01-01 language:swift sort:updated"}

The tool returns repository information including name, description, URLs, and other metadata for each matching repository.
```

```
Task:
how to using github mcp server?

You need to click the "Plan/Act" toggle button below the chat interface to switch from Plan mode to Act mode. I cannot toggle modes myself - only you can do this manually.

Once you've toggled to Act mode, I'll be able to use the GitHub MCP server tools to perform the repository search for Swift LSP implementations.

{
  "query": "swift sourcekit-lsp language:swift sort:stars"
}

‚òëÔ∏è Task Completed
Based on the GitHub search results, here are the most relevant Swift LSP implementations:

sourcekit-lsp (swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp)
Apple's official LSP implementation
Built on sourcekitd and clangd
Provides code-completion and jump-to-definition functionality
Supports both Swift Package Manager projects and projects with compile_commands.json
Included in official Swift toolchains and Xcode
Most actively maintained and widely used implementation

LSPService (codeface-io/LSPService)
Focuses on using local LSP servers via WebSockets
Good for network-based LSP implementations
LSP-Types (AuroraEditor/LSP-Types)
New implementation (2024) focusing on LSP 3.16.0 types
Includes support for proposed 3.17 features
Part of the AuroraEditor project

For implementing LSP in a Swift project, sourcekit-lsp is the recommended choice since it's:

Official Apple implementation
Well-maintained
Integrated with Swift toolchain
Supports both Swift and C-based languages
Has cross-language support and powerful source code indexing
```

## Language Server Protocol (LSP)

> The Language Server Protocol (LSP) defines the protocol used between an editor or IDE and a language server that provides language features like auto complete, go to definition, find all references etc. The goal of the Language Server Index Format (LSIF, pronounced like "else if") is to support rich code navigation in development tools or a Web UI without needing a local copy of the source code.

[SourceKit-LSP](https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp)

SourceKit-LSP is an implementation of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for Swift and C-based languages. It provides intelligent editor functionality like code-completion and jump-to-definition to editors that support LSP. SourceKit-LSP is built on top of sourcekitd and clangd for high-fidelity language support, and provides a powerful source code index as well as cross-language support. SourceKit-LSP supports projects that use the Swift Package Manager and projects that generate a compile_commands.json file, such as CMake.

**SourceKit-LSP is included in the the Swift toolchains available on swift.org and is bundled with Xcode.**

*Note*
> If you are using SourceKit-LSP with a SwiftPM project in which you need to pass additional arguments to the swift build invocation, as is commonly the case for embedded projects, you need to teach SourceKit-LSP about those arguments as described in Using SourceKit-LSP with Embedded Projects.

## [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/resources/intro-llms)

### What is a language model?

A language model is a machine learning model that aims to predict and generate plausible language. Autocomplete is a language model, for example.

These models work by estimating the probability of a token or sequence of tokens occurring within a longer sequence of tokens. Consider the following sentence:

`When I hear rain on my roof, I _______ in my kitchen.`

If you assume that a token is a word, then a language model determines the probabilities of different words or sequences of words to replace that underscore. For example, a language model might determine the following probabilities:
```
cook soup 9.4%
warm up a kettle 5.2%
cower 3.6%
nap 2.5%
relax 2.2%
...
```
A "sequence of tokens" could be an entire sentence or a series of sentences. That is, a language model could calculate the likelihood of different entire sentences or blocks of text.

Estimating the probability of what comes next in a sequence is useful for all kinds of things: generating text, translating languages, and answering questions, to name a few.

### What is a large language model?

Modeling human language at scale is a highly complex and resource-intensive endeavor. The path to reaching the current capabilities of language models and large language models has spanned several decades.

As models are built bigger and bigger, their complexity and efficacy increases. Early language models could predict the probability of a single word; modern large language models can predict the probability of sentences, paragraphs, or even entire documents.

The size and capability of language models has exploded over the last few years as computer memory, dataset size, and processing power increases, and more effective techniques for modeling longer text sequences are developed.

### How large is large?

The definition is fuzzy, but "large" has been used to describe BERT (110M parameters) as well as PaLM 2 (up to 340B parameters).

Parameters are the weights the model learned during training, used to predict the next token in the sequence. "Large" can refer either to the number of parameters in the model, or sometimes the number of words in the dataset.

## [the Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

Qdrant is written in Rust ü¶Ä, which makes it fast and reliable even under high load.

With Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more!

## [Prompt engineering for Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/copilot-chat/prompt-engineering-for-copilot-chat)

Follow these strategies to improve your Copilot results.

### Start general, then get specific

```
Write a function that tells me if a number is prime

The function should take an integer and return true if the integer is prime

The function should error if the input is not a positive integer
```

### Give examples
```
Write a function that finds all dates in a string and returns them in an array. Dates can be formatted like:

05/02/24
05/02/2024
5/2/24
5/2/2024
05-02-24
05-02-2024
5-2-24
5-2-2024
Example:

findDates("I have a dentist appointment on 11/14/2023 and book club on 12-1-23")

Returns: ["11/14/2023", "12-1-23"]
```

### Break complex tasks into simpler tasks
If you want Copilot to complete a complex or large task, break the task into multiple simple, small tasks.

For example, instead of asking Copilot to generate a word search puzzle, break the process down into smaller tasks, and ask Copilot to accomplish them one by one:

- Write a function to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters.
- Write a function to find all words in a grid of letters, given a list of valid words.
- Write a function that uses the previous functions to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters that contains at least 10 words.
- Update the previous function to print the grid of letters and 10 random words from the grid.

### Avoid ambiguity

Avoid ambiguous terms. For example, don‚Äôt ask "what does this do" if "this" could be the current file, the last Copilot response, or a specific code block. Instead, be specific:

- What does the `createUser` function do?
- What does the code in your last response do?

Ambiguity can also apply to libraries:

- If you are using an uncommon library, describe what the library does.
- If you want to use a specific library, set the import statements at the top of the file or specify what library you want to use.

### Indicate relevant code

If you are using Copilot in your IDE to get suggestions as you code, open any relevant files and close irrelevant files. Copilot will use the open files to understand your request.

If you are using Copilot Chat in your IDE, open the file or highlight the code that you want Copilot to reference. You can also use keywords to manually supply context to Copilot Chat. For example, you can add the `@workspace` chat participant in VS Code, or `@project` in JetBrains IDEs. See [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/github-copilot-chat-cheat-sheet).

### Experiment and iterate

If you don‚Äôt get the result that you want, iterate on your prompt and try again.

If you are using Copilot to get suggestions as you code, you can delete the suggestion entirely and start over. Or you can keep the suggestion and request modifications.

If you are using Copilot Chat, you can reference the previous response in your next request. Or, you can delete the previous response and start over.

### Keep history relevant

Copilot Chat uses the chat history to get context about your request. To give Copilot only the relevant history:

- Use threads to start a new conversation for a new task
- Delete requests that are no longer relevant or that didn‚Äôt give you the desired result

### Follow good coding practices

If you aren't getting the responses you want when you ask Copilot for suggestions or explanations in your codebase, make sure that your existing code follows best practices and is easy to read. For example:

- Use a consistent code style and patterns
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- Comment your code
- Structure your code into modular, scoped components
- Include unit tests

*Tip*

> Use Copilot to help your code follow best practices. For example, ask Copilot to add comments or to break a large function into smaller functions.
