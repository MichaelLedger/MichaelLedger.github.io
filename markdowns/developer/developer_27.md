# Swift Package Manager(SPM) Best Practice

## Environments
MacOS 15.2
Xcode 16.2

## Practice
Use Xcode to open `Package.swift`.

## Search Scope
Need switch search scope as `In Project/Workspace and Package Dependencies` to searching in all codes, including package codes.

## [PromiseKit installation](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/blob/master/Documentation/Installation.md)

### Accio
Add the following to your Package.swift:

`.package(url: "https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "6.8.4")),`

Next, add `PromiseKit` to your App targets dependencies like so:

```
.target(
    name: "App",
    dependencies: [
        "PromiseKit",
    ]
),
```
Then run `accio update`.

### SwiftPM
```
package.dependencies.append(
    .package(url: "https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit", from: "6.8.0")
)
```
### Manually
You can just drop `PromiseKit.xcodeproj` into your project and then add `PromiseKit.framework` to your app‚Äôs embedded frameworks.

## [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio) - ‚ö†Ô∏èDeprecated
A dependency manager driven by SwiftPM that works for iOS/tvOS/watchOS/macOS projects.
With the release of Xcode 12 which includes Swift 5.3, we feel like there is no gap left to fill by Accio on the move to SwiftPM anymore, thus we are deprecating support for Accio in those versions, instead please use the built-in SwiftPM feature in Xcode.

## [Tuist](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/) - üî•Recommend
[Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) is a toolchain designed to accelerate and enhance app development. 

### [Cache](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/quick-start/optimize-workflows)

If you clean build the project, which you usually do on CI or after cleaning the global cache in the hope of fixing cryptic compilation issues, you have to compile the whole project from scratch. When the project becomes large, this can take a long time.

Tuist solves that by re-using binaries from previous builds. Run the following command:

`tuist cache`
The command will build and share all the cacheable targets in your project in a local and remote cache. After it completes, try generating the project:

`tuist generate`
You'll notice your project groups includes a new group Cache containing the binaries from the cache.

An screenshot of a project group structure where you can see XCFrameworks in a cache group
If you push your changes upstream to a remote repository, other developers can clone the project, and run the following commands:
```
tuist install
tuist auth
tuist generate
```
And they'll suddenly get a project with the dependencies as binaries.

## [Linking the package only in debug builds](https://augmentedcode.io/2022/05/02/linking-a-swift-package-only-in-debug-builds/)
App target‚Äôs libraries.Then we‚Äôll open build settings and look for ‚ÄúExcluded Source File Names‚Äù and configure release builds to ignore ‚Äú[LookinServer*](https://github.com/QMUI/LookinServer)‚Äù.

Build settings configured to ignore the package in release builds.To verify this change, we can make a release build with shift+command+i (Product -> Build For -> Profiling which builds release configuration). If we check the latest build log with command+9 and clicking on the top most build item, scrolling to app target‚Äôs linker step, we can see that Xcode did not link ‚ÄúLookinServer‚Äù. Exactly what we wanted to achieve.

// Podfile
`pod 'LookinServer',    '1.2.6',    :configurations => ['Debug']`

// Build Settings -> Excluded Source File Names 
`"EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES[arch=*]" = "LookinServer*";`

## [Is it okay to have both SPM and Cocoapods in your project?](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/16dvujc/is_it_okay_to_have_both_spm_and_cocoapods_in_your/)

No one's mentioned this, but yes, it can work, as long as the dependencies on each side have independent trees.

**That is, all of the CocoaPods dependencies should be separate from all the SPM dependencies. Otherwise you're going to get duplicate symbol errors or other build issues.**

At best you'd increase your app size with duplicate libraries.

## SPM mixed with CocoaPods

[cocoapods-spm](https://github.com/trinhngocthuyen/cocoapods-spm)

This plugin will auto add swift packages to `Pods.xcodeproj` for spm_pkg in `Podfile`.

**NOTE: you may manully add the same swift package in your main project if this package is used in main project.**
 
// Gemfile

`gem "cocoapods-spm", '~>0.1.9'`

Run `bundle install`

**Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.**

```
% bundle info cocoapods-spm
  * cocoapods-spm (0.1.11)
    Summary: CocoaPods plugin to add SPM dependencies to CocoaPods targets
    Homepage: https://github.com/trinhngocthuyen/cocoapods-spm
    Path: /Users/gavinxiang/.rbenv/versions/3.3.5/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/gems/cocoapods-spm-0.1.11
```

// Podfile
```
  spm_pkg 'SDWebImage',
  :url => "git@github.com:SDWebImage/SDWebImage.git",
  :version => "5.20.0",
  :products => ["SDWebImage-SPM"]
  
  spm_pkg 'SDWebImageWebPCoder',
  :url => "git@github.com:SDWebImage/SDWebImageWebPCoder.git",
  :version => "0.14.6",
  :products => ["SDWebImageWebPCoder-SPM"]
  
  pod 'XXXKit1', :git => "git@github.com:organization/XXXKit1.git", :branch => "Feature-SPM-001"
  pod 'XXXKit2', '~> 8.22.0'
  pod 'XXXKit3', :path => '../../XXXKit3'
```

Assume `XXXKit1`,`XXXKit2`,`XXXKit3` depends on `SDWebImage` & `YYYKit1`,`YYYKit2` depends on `SnapKit`.

**Add `.spm.pods/` & `.build/` to `.gitignore` when using spm with cocoapods-spm plugin.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è If library target name has been changed, you need manually delete these files:
```
`<targe_name>.json` in path: `.spm.pods/packages/metadata`
corresponding checkout in `.spm.pods/packages/.umbrella/.build/checkouts/<repo_name>`
corresponding basedOn/packageRef/state in `.spm.pods/packages/.umbrella/.build/workspace-state.json`
```
to force reload it then recall `bundle exec pod install --verbose`.**

**It is recommended to delete the entire folder `.spm.pods` directly. Complex nested dependencies make it difficult to accurately locate the libraries that need to be deleted.**

Below shows `FileDownloadManager` not been updated as `MDFileDownloadManager` which defined in Package.swift, which causing Xcode build always failed!

## swift package resolve & swift package update

We need to call `swift package resolve` this will only update the resolved file, while `swift package update` updates the swift file too with latest available updates.

## unable to initiate PIF transfer session

Build service could not create build operation: unknown error while handling message: MsgHandlingError(message: "unable to initiate PIF transfer session (operation in progress?)")

relaunch Xcode to refetch the remote package dependencies.

## Module 'XXX' not found

Using Forward Declarations to resolve circular-import-error: Module 'BraintreeCore' not found

If spm module is not found, first check `Link Binary With Libraries`; then if import codes exists in C Header, there must exists circular import error.

Causing by specific Objective-C header imported spm swift module && Bridging Header imported this specific Objective-C header.

This problem has been bothering me all day to location. 

(reset package dependency -> relink library -> check framework/header search paths -> test Demo from braintree -> check target build phases shells)

## Remaining issues

### Issue 1. two same spm depencies in `Pods.xcodeproj`
[cocoapods-spm](https://github.com/trinhngocthuyen/cocoapods-spm) hook after `running post integrate hooks`, so there may exists two same spm depencies in `Pods.xcodeproj`.

App extension & main project should **manully** add spm depencies & add spm library/framework in `Link Binary With Libraries` to avoid `no such module` issue.

### Issue 2. `pod lib lint` or `pod repo push` fails if replacing `dependency` with `spm_dependency` even install cocoapods-spm plugin.

`$ pod repo push mine_specs 'XXX.podspec' --sources='https://cdn.cocoapods.org/,git@github.com:XXX/mine_specs.git' --allow-warnings --skip-import-validation --skip-tests --verbose --local-only`

  Cleaning up sandbox directory

Integrating client project

[!] Please close any current Xcode sessions and use `App.xcworkspace` for this project from now on.
```

In addition to the `post_install` hook function, there is another hook function in cocoapods, `pre_install`, which allows us to do something after the pod library has been downloaded but not installed, and the `post_install` hook function allows us to do something before the project is written to the hard disk.

```
# pre_install hook that removes unwanted localizations
pre_install do |installer|
    supported_locales = ['base', 'da', 'en']

    Dir.glob(File.join(installer.sandbox.pod_dir('FormatterKit'), '**', '*.lproj')).each do |bundle|
        if (!supported_locales.include?(File.basename(bundle, ".lproj").downcase))
            puts "Removing #{bundle}"
            FileUtils.rm_rf(bundle)
        end
    end
end
```

### Issue4: [critical cross-dependency bug](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/issues/4581)

Note: There is a critical cross-dependency bug affecting many projects including [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift?tab=readme-ov-file) in Swift Package Manager. We've filed a bug (SR-12303) in early 2020 but have no answer yet. Your mileage may vary. A partial workaround can be found [here](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/issues/2127#issuecomment-717830502).

**For my project it work great. In build settings for main app in chapter build options I change `Enable Testing Search Path` from `NO` to `YES`. I think, that is allow to find path to XCTest framework and use necessary symbol.**

```
// swift-tools-version:5.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "RxProject",
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "6.0.0"))
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(name: "RxProject", dependencies: ["RxSwift", .product(name: "RxCocoa", package: "RxSwift")]),
  ]
)
```

### Issue5: Compile is passed but archive failed with module not find in some cocoapods libraray generating process.

```
[0m/Volumes/ExDisk/Jenkins-workspace/FPA-000-SPM-Mix-CocoaPods-Feature/FreePrints/Pods/XXXSDK/LoginViewModel.swift:9:8: [31mno such module 'RxRelay'[0m
```

You can manullay add lost module in pod target's target dependencies to resolve this archive error. (e.g. add `RxRelay` in XXXSDK's `target dependencies`)

It's hard to add dependency via shell command because `pod install` will reset all `target dependencies`.

## Best practice: publish static library & dynamic framework simultaneously via [distributing binary frameworks](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-binary-frameworks-as-swift-packages)

*Maybe this resolution can resolve 'RxRelay' & 'RxSwift' critical cross-dependency bug.*

### [Checksums on zip files to verify whether zip files is modified](https://superuser.com/questions/1786609/zip-file-to-verify-if-not-modified)

On macOS in the terminal you can run the following to get **the SHA-256 checksum** of your ZIP archive:

```
$ shasum -a 256 AppsFlyerLib-Dynamic-SPM.xcframework.zip

c0bee56914a3d09e99b9c9c36c1444b0926e050396777b3e470b09212bd9b4bf  AppsFlyerLib-Dynamic-SPM.xcframework.zip
```

The checksum of the ZIP archive can the be checked/generated on any system (each system with their own method) and if it matches with the one you generated it means the file wasn't modified.

## Practice
### Could use different tags to distinguish between cocoapods and spm.

[GoogleUtilities - 8.0.2](https://github.com/google/GoogleUtilities/releases/tag/8.0.2)

[GoogleUtilities - CocoaPods-8.0.2](https://github.com/google/GoogleUtilities/releases/tag/CocoaPods-8.0.2)

- Swift Package Manager

By creating and pushing a tag for Swift PM, the newly tagged version will be immediately released for public use. Given this, please verify the intended time of release for Swift PM.

Add a version tag for Swift PM
```
git tag {version}
git push origin {version}
```
Note: Ensure that any inflight PRs that depend on the new GoogleUtilities version are updated to point to the newly tagged version rather than a checksum.

- CocoaPods

Publish the newly versioned pod to CocoaPods

It's recommended to point to the GoogleUtilities.podspec in staging to make sure the correct spec is being published.

`pod trunk push ~/.cocoapods/repos/staging/GoogleUtilities/{version}/GoogleUtilities.podspec.json`

Note: In some cases, it may be acceptable to `pod trunk push` with the `--skip-tests` flag. Please double check with the maintainers before doing so.

The pod push was successful if the above command logs: üöÄ  GoogleUtilities ({version}) successfully published. In addition, a new commit that publishes the new version (co-authored by CocoaPodsAtGoogle) should appear in the CocoaPods specs repo. Last, the latest version should be displayed on GoogleUtilities's CocoaPods page.

### [`library(name:type:targets:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/product/library(name:type:targets:))

> A library‚Äôs product can be either statically or dynamically linked. It‚Äôs recommended that you don‚Äôt explicitly declare the type of library, so Swift Package Manager can choose between static or dynamic linking based on the preference of the package‚Äôs consumer.

### [Understanding Static Library vs Dynamic Library in iOS Swift](https://medium.com/takodigital/understanding-static-library-vs-dynamic-library-in-ios-swift-f675f603a050)

Understanding the differences between static libraries and dynamic libraries is essential for iOS Swift developers.

**Static libraries provide simplicity, performance, and code protection, while dynamic libraries offer code sharing, versioning flexibility, and dynamic loading capabilities.**

By choosing the appropriate type of library based on your project‚Äôs requirements, you can optimize your development process and create efficient, scalable iOS applications.

### Try add swift package library to pod target's target denpendecies

## [Should I git ignore xcodeproject/project.pbxproj file?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8026429/should-i-git-ignore-xcodeproject-project-pbxproj-file)
Update in the light of Swift Package Manager:
If you're building a project as a **Swift package (SDK: library/framework)** - you should definitely ignore this file as it can be generated using file system as source of truth. You can do that by using the following command:

```
$ cd ~/Projects/MyProjectFolder/
$ swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

For non-SwiftPM answer - see below.
This file holds the list of all the files in the project, settings of targets and which files belong to which targets. It's probably the meatiest file in project bundle. **You should not ignore this file**. There are few points for this:
    1    You may not want to work on this project alone or;
    2    You're planning on working on project from different machines;
    3    You'll want to share your code base with others;

## [Bundling resources with a Swift package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package#Explicitly-declare-or-exclude-resources)

Add resource files to your Swift package and access them in your code.

Explicitly declare or exclude resources

To add a resource that Xcode can‚Äôt handle automatically, explicitly declare it as a resource in your package manifest. The following example assumes that text.txt resides in Sources/MyLibrary and you want to include it in the MyLibrary target. To explicitly declare it as a package resource, you pass its file name to the target‚Äôs initializer in your package manifest:

```
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "MyLibrary",
        resources: [
            .process("text.txt")]
    ),
]
```

Note how the example code above uses the `process(_:localization:)` function. When you explicitly declare a resource, you must choose one of these rules to determine how Xcode treats the resource file:

*Process rule*

For most use cases, use `process(_:localization:)` to apply this rule and have Xcode process the resource according to the platform you‚Äôre building the package for. For example, Xcode may optimize image files for a platform that supports such optimizations. If you apply the process rule to a directory‚Äôs path, Xcode applies the rule recursively to the directory‚Äôs contents. If no special processing is available for a resource, Xcode copies the resource to the resource bundle‚Äôs top-level directory.

*Copy rule*

Some Swift packages may require a resource file to remain untouched or to retain a certain directory structure for resources. Use the `copy(_:)` function to apply this rule and have Xcode copy the resource as is to the top level of the resource bundle. If you pass a directory path to the copy rule, Xcode retains the directory‚Äôs structure.

If a file resides inside a target‚Äôs folder and you don‚Äôt want it to be a package resource, pass it to the target initializer‚Äôs exclude parameter. The next example assumes that instructions.md is a Markdown file that contains documentation, resides at Sources/MyLibrary and shouldn‚Äôt be part of the package‚Äôs resource bundle. This code shows how you can exclude the file from the target by adding it to the list of excluded files:

**Access a resource in code**

When you build your Swift package, Xcode treats each target as a Swift module. If a target includes resources, Xcode creates a resource bundle and an internal static extension on Bundle to access it for each module. Use the extension to locate package resources. For example, use the following to retrieve the URL of a property list you bundle with your package:

`let settingsURL = Bundle.module.url(forResource: "settings", withExtension: "plist")`

Important
**Always use Bundle.module when you access resources. A package shouldn‚Äôt make assumptions about the exact location of a resource.**

If you want to make a package resource available to apps that depend on your Swift package, declare a public constant for it. For example, use the following to expose a property list file to apps that use your Swift package:
`let settingsURL = Bundle.module.url(forResource: "settings", withExtension: "plist")`

```

            if let bundle = bundlePath.flatMap(Bundle.init(url:)) {
                return bundle
            }
        }

### Xcode - Add github account with PAT (Personal Access Token)
xcode -> Settings... -> Accounts -> add GitHub account ‚ûï
GitHub personal access tokens must have these scopes set:
```
‚òëÔ∏è admin:public_key
‚òëÔ∏è write:discussion
‚òëÔ∏è repo
‚òëÔ∏è user
```
Clong Using SSH, choose your `github-rsa` file.
### Jenkins - Private git repos need [PAT (Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
```
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com':
terminal prompts disabledskipping cache due to an error:
Failed to clone repository https://github.com/XXX/xxx.git:
```
PAT generate method:
Github -> Avator -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Tokens -> Generate new token -> Select scopes same as Xcode package dependencies required.

Copy the github url that the project is located. It should be https://github.com/GITHUB_USER_NAME/Project1.git

> Note: Starting from 13 Aug, 2021, you need to access github via personal access token therefore first you will need to create a personal access token in your github account and then you will access the repo url in this format: https://PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/GITHUB_USER_NAME/Project1.git

*Add PAT in Jenkins*
Manage Jenkins -> Credentials -> choose System(Store) + Global(Domain) -> Add Credentials -> Use PAT as password

*Add private git repositories in Jenkins Jobs*
Job -> Configure -> Source Code Management -> Git Repositories -> Add Repository (URL + Credentials)

// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MDFileDownloadManager",
    products: [
        // Products define the executables and libraries a package produces, making them visible to other packages.
        .library(
            name: "MDFileDownloadManager",
            targets: ["MDFileDownloadManager"])
    ],
    targets: [
        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package, defining a module or a test suite.
        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package and products from dependencies.
        .target(
            name: "MDFileDownloadManager",
            path: "Sources/MDFileDownloadManager",
            publicHeadersPath: "include"
        )
    ]
)
```

```
//
//  MDFileDownloadManager.h
//  MDFileDownloadManager

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "MDFileDownloadConfig.h"
#import "MDDownloadOperation.h"
```

Although `MDFileDownloadCache.h` is contained in `include` directory, but we cannot use `MDFileDownloadCache` outside of the package, Xcode build failed with error:

`Use of undeclared identifier 'MDFileDownloadCache'`

Resolution:
Manually expose all `include` headers in target namesake file header `MDFileDownloadManager.h` for OC package like this:

```
//
//  MDFileDownloadManager.h
//  MDFileDownloadManager

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "MDFileDownloadConfig.h"
#import "MDDownloadOperation.h"
#import "MDDownloadConfigModel.h"
#import "DownloadSessionConfiguration.h"
#import "MDFileDownloadCache.h"
#import "MDFileDownloadManagerDefine.h"
#import "MDFileDownloadManagerDelegate.h"
#import "MDFileModel.h"
#import "NSString+MDFileDownloaderMD5.h"
```

Another resolution is rename the target for this package like this (*Not recommended*):
```
// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MDFileDownloadManager",
    products: [
        // Products define the executables and libraries a package produces, making them visible to other packages.
        .library(
            name: "MDFileDownloadManager",
            targets: ["FileDownloadManager"])
    ],
    targets: [
        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package, defining a module or a test suite.
        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package and products from dependencies.
        .target(
            name: "FileDownloadManager",
            path: "Sources/FileDownloadManager",
            publicHeadersPath: "include"
        )
    ]
)

```
