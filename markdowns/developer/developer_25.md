# MacOS - Unable to install ruby 3.x on M1 (Apple Silicon)

## Preface

> Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

This problem occurred because I had used a Time Machine backup from an x86_64 machine. That led to me having the wrong version of several libraries (such as ruby, should be `arm64-darwin23`), and possibly of Homebrew itself.
```
% ruby -v
ruby 3.0.0p0 (2020-12-25 revision 95aff21468) [x86_64-darwin20]
```

## Resolution

**At first, you need migrating Homebrew from Intel to M1!**

```
## Migrating Homebrew from Intel to M1

## You can copy and paste into the Terminal

## Go to home directory
cd ;

## Create list of installed Intel packages
brew bundle dump ;

## Install new version of Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)" ;

## Update the PATH to point to M1 version first
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)" ;
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc ;

## Migrate Intel packages (/usr/local/bin/brew) to M1 (/opt/Homebrew)
## You may need to enter your sysadmin password
brew bundle --file Brewfile ;

## Update packages
brew update ; 

## Upgrade packages
brew upgrade ;

## Clean up
brew cleanup ;

## Uninstall old Intel version

# Download uninstall script
curl -fsSL -o ./uninstall.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh ;

# Run the uninstall specifying the old path
sudo /bin/bash ./uninstall.sh --path=/usr/local ;
# Enter password
# Type Y to uninstall

# Delete uninstall script
rm uninstall.sh ;

# Final cleanup
brew cleanup ;
```

**Install ruby 3.3.5 by rbenv**
`RUBY_CFLAGS="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration" RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3 --with-libyaml-dir=/opt/homebrew/opt/libyaml" rbenv install 3.3.5`

system openssl path: `/usr/local/Cellar/openssl@3` & `/usr/local/Cellar/libyaml`
```
% brew --prefix openssl
/usr/local/opt/openssl@3
% brew --prefix libyaml
/usr/local/opt/libyaml
```

Install ruby 3.x using `openssl@3` & `libyaml` opt in **homebrew**, not in system!

```
% opt git:(stable) pwd
/opt/homebrew/opt
% opt git:(stable) ls
ca-certificates openssl         openssl@3.3     ruby@3
libyaml         openssl@3       ruby            ruby@3.3
```

## [Terminal: run `source ~/.bash_profile` every time start new terminal [closed]](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/315985/terminal-run-source-bash-profile-every-time-start-new-terminal)
Need to run `source ~/.zshrc` OR `source ~/.bash_profile` for every new shell in terminal. 

If you are using [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh), the default one that will be loaded automatically is `~/.zshrc`. All you need to do is adding the following at the end of `~/.zshrc`:

```
if [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then
  . ~/.bash_profile
fi
```

It works! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### RVM also need install `ruby-3.3.5 [arm64]`

```

`$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`

`% RUBY_CFLAGS="-w" rbenv install 3.3.5`

`% RUBY_CFLAGS="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration -Wmacro-redefined" rvm reinstall "ruby-3.3.5" --with-openssl-dir=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3 --with-libyaml-dir=/opt/homebrew/opt/libyaml`

```
% rvm gemset list
Warning! PATH is not properly set up, /Users/gavinxiang/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.3.5@global/bin is not at first place.
         Usually this is caused by shell initialization files. Search for PATH=... entries.
         You can also re-add RVM to your profile by running: rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles
         To fix it temporarily in this shell session run: rvm use ruby-3.3.5@global
         To ignore this error add rvm_silence_path_mismatch_check_flag=1 to your ~/.rvmrc file.

### install old ruby with this openssl
```
$ rvm pkg install openssl
$ rvm install 2.3.1 --with-openssl-dir=$HOME/.rvm/usr
```

### Remark for Ruby version 3+
When install ruby v3, we may specific openssl location.
Check your openssl location before installation
- location A
```
$ ls /usr/local/opt | grep openssl
openssl
openssl@1.1
openssl@3
openssl@3.1
```
`$ rvm install ruby-3.1.0 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@3.1`

- location B
```
$ ls /opt/homebrew/opt | grep openssl
openssl
openssl@1.1
openssl@3
openssl@3.1
```
`$ rvm install ruby-3.1.0 --with-openssl-dir=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3.1`

## Tips
### brew --prefix <formula>
Display the location in the cellar where formula is or would be installed.
```
% brew --prefix
/usr/local
% brew --prefix openssl@3
/usr/local/opt/openssl@3
```

### Find latest stable releases for each Ruby
```
% rbenv install -l
3.1.6
3.2.5
3.3.5
jruby-9.4.8.0
mruby-3.3.0
picoruby-3.0.0
truffleruby-24.1.0
truffleruby+graalvm-24.1.0

Only latest stable releases for each Ruby implementation are shown.
Use `rbenv install --list-all' to show all local versions.
```

### Check if you have other Ruby managers
Run these commands in your terminal:
`rbenv help`
`rvm help`
`asdf --help`
`frum versions`

### rbenv doctor
`curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash`

```
% curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
Checking for `rbenv' in PATH: /usr/local/bin/rbenv
Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: found at wrong position
  The directory `/Users/gavinxiang/.rbenv/shims' is present in PATH, but is listed too late.
  The Ruby version found in `/Users/gavinxiang/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.0.0/bin' will have precedence. Please reorder your PATH.

Checking `rbenv install' support: /usr/local/bin/rbenv-install (ruby-build 20240917)
Counting installed Ruby versions: 2 versions
Auditing installed plugins: OK
```
[Trying to install rbenv but running into this problem: "Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: not found" #1217](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/issues/1217)
I ran `source ~/.bash_profile` and then `echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile` and after that the rbenv doctor script printout matches that in the instructions, so I think this is resolved.

### Check terminal whether in Rosetta mode
If youâ€™re on an Apple Silicon Mac, make sure Terminal is NOT in Rosetta mode.
You can check by running this command once Terminal opens:
`uname -m`
It should say `arm64` if youâ€™re on an Apple Silicon Mac. If it says `x86_64`, that means Terminal (or whatever terminal app youâ€™re using, such as iTerm) is in Rosetta mode.

### choose which version `openssl`?
As I have described in this blog post of mine, you need to specify the path to the version of OpenSSL that your version of Ruby requires:
Ruby `3.1` and `newer`, use:
`RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@3)" rbenv install 3.1.0`
Ruby `2.4` to `3.0`, use:
`RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)" rbenv install 2.4.0`
Ruby `2.3` and `older`, use
`RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@1)" rbenv install 2.3.0`

### rbenv not changing ruby version?

To ensure that rbenv is correctly loaded when we start a new shell, I had to edit a couple of files. I added the following line to `.zshenv`:

`export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"`

This adds gem-specific binaries to the PATH so that they are accessible to the shell without fully qualifying them with their path.

Then I added the following lines to `.zshrc`:

```
source $HOME/.zshenv
eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"
```

This ensures that the previous file is sourced when a new session is started and that rbenv is initialized for Zsh.

At this point, youâ€™ll want to source .zshrc (or simply restart the terminal of your choice like iTerm2, instead):

`$ source ~/.zshrc`

With `rbenv` ready to go, I installed the latest version of Ruby and set it as my global default for this machine.

`$ rbenv global 3.3.5` OR `$ rbenv local 3.3.5`

```
$ cat ~/.ruby-version 
3.3.5
```

Check that PATH contains `$HOME/.rbenv/shim`s and `$HOME/.rbenv/bin`
`$ env | grep PATH`
Also check that you have the following in your `~/.bash_profile` if using bash or `~/.zshenv` if using zsh
```
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```
You can just run `echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile` to add text at the end of file.

After edited, just run `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.zshrc` in your terminal to make it work.

### Check your Xcode Command Line Tools version

```
% pkgutil --pkg-info=com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables | grep version
version: 15.3.0.0.1.1708646388
```

### where is ruby 3.0.0 on rbenv
You need to update the available versions via ruby-build
```
% git -C ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build pull
% rbenv install 3.0.0
...
Installed ruby-3.0.0 to ~/.rbenv/versions/3.0.0
```

### Update Ruby
1. brew update && brew upgrade ruby-build
2. rbenv install 3.3.5
3. rbenv local 3.3.5  (with bundle) /   rbenv global 3.3.5 (without bundle)
4. ruby --version  (check ruby version)

### Update bundler
1. bundle update --bundler   
2. bundler --version  (check bundler version)

### [On My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)

### Zsh Shell

Now let me see the version of Bash that's shipped with macOS Sonoma 14.5 in Apple M1 Pro.

```
% sw_vers
ProductName:        macOS
ProductVersion:        14.5
BuildVersion:        23F79

% bash -version

```

*What is Zsh?*

Zsh, read as Z shell is a Unix Shell (Bash is a Unix Shell as well)

Zsh shell is shipped as the default login and interactive shell with Apple macOS since Catalina

It is an extension of sh (Bourne shell)

Zsh is incorporated with most of the features from bash, zsh, tcsh and sh shell along with many new features.

Zsh is also a powerful scripting language.

*History of Zsh?*

The first version of Zsh was written by Paul Falstad in the 1990

The name zsh has been derived from the name of professor Zhong Shao of Yale University.

`~/.zshenv` : Zsh Environment File

`% nano ~/.zshenv`
