**iOS Dependency manager**

When you do not use a Dependency manager as a developer you are responsible for:

- finding a dependency
- resolving a dependency graph and versioning
- downloading the sources
- add the dependency into Xcode

And when you decide to upgrade the dependency you should start this process from the beginning

Dependency manager is a tool that helps user to add a dependency into a project with a minimum affords

## CocoaPods
CocoaPods is an open-source, centralised dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects which is being written on Ruby. It Supports Dynamic Frameworks and Static Libraries

Notes:

- CocoaPods needs to have a workspace
- A consumer project does not have a clean view of dependencies `<Pods_target-name.framework>`
- All dependencies are rebuild every time when you build the project. It increases build time as a workaround take a look at cocoapods-binary
- It is not possible to use different pod versions in the same workspace
`CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod`

## Carthage
Carthage is an open-source, decentralised dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects which is being written on Swift. It supports Dynamic Frameworks and Static Libraries

Notes:

As a consumer project developer you are responsible for setup Xcode with a dependency. It creates some extra steps in IDE
As a dependency developer you do not have some instruments(e.g. subspecs)

```
$ brew install carthage
$ carthage version
```

Create an empty Cartfile with the touch command:
`touch Cartfile`

Then open the file in Xcode for editing:
`open -a Xcode Cartfile`

Add the following lines to the Cartfile and save it:
```
github "Alamofire/Alamofire" == 4.9.0
github "Alamofire/AlamofireImage" ~> 3.4
```
These two lines tell Carthage that your project requires Alamofire version 4.9.0 and the latest version of AlamofireImage that‚Äôs compatible with version 3.4.

Now open the Terminal App on your Mac and type

`carthage update`

["Building universal frameworks with common architectures is not possible." error #3146](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/3146)

**I've encountered a similar problem and it is not the perfect solution, but you can use the same workaround as described here [Xcode12Workaround.md](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Xcode12Workaround.md) to fix this problem. Cheers**

```
‚ûú  ~ which carthage
/usr/local/bin/carthage
‚ûú  ~ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/carthage
```

You have successfully integrated your dependency! üéâ

Let's see what you have done:

You have specified that your dependency is on GitHub and is on the Alamofire/Alamofire repository.
That‚Äôs all! But a lot of things happened under the hood.

Carthage created a `Cartfile.resolved` file to let other developers, or you, add the same version of the same dependencies to your app. If your project is under version control, you would normally push this file to the repository.

It created a `Carthage` folder in your project root folder. Inside this folder, it checked out every dependency declared in your Cartfile. If your project is under version control, you would normally push this file to the repository as well.

It also created a `Build` folder inside it, where you will find a folder for every platform that your dependencies support. For example, for Alamofire, a framework that supports all Apple platforms, you will find iOS, Mac, tvOS, and watchOS folders.

If you want to only build dependencies for a specified platform, use `carthage update --platform iOS` command.

Inside every platform folder, you will find all the frameworks that support that platform (you will also find other files and a `.dSYM` file, which is used for desymbolising crash logs).

There are a few other steps we need to do (from official repository documentation):

1. Drag the built `.framework` binaries from `Carthage/Build/<platform>` into your application‚Äôs Xcode project.

2. On your application targets‚Äô Build Phases settings tab, click the + icon and choose New Run Script Phase. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: `/bin/sh`), add the following contents to the script area below the shell:
`/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`

3. Add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under ‚ÄúInput Files":
`$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Alamofire.framework`

4. Add the paths to the copied frameworks to the ‚ÄúOutput Files‚Äù:
`$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/Alamofire.framework`

Go to your Swift file and type
`import Alamofire`

You can now use Alamofire inside your file!

Note: This Carthage tutorial uses Swift 5. At the time of writing, Swift 5 is only available in Xcode 11. Ensure you‚Äôve configured your command line tools to use Xcode 11 by running the following command from Terminal:
`sudo xcode-select -s <path to Xcode 11>/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`

Be sure to replace path to Xcode 11 with your machine‚Äôs specific path to Xcode 11.

This instructs Carthage to clone the Git repositories from the Cartfile, then to build each dependency into a framework. 

```
carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform iOS
```

Build with `--use-xcframeworks` to create an xcframework bundle instead.

## Swift Package Manager(SPM)
Swift Package Manager(SPM) is an open-source, decentralised dependency manager which is being written on Swift. It supports Dynamic and Static library. .xcodeproj is not used. If you want to distribute closed-source(binary framework) you should use XCFramework.

**CocoaPods by default builds open-source pods every time(after clean or any unknown reason) which increase build time(but you can use [cocoapods-binary](https://guides.cocoapods.org/plugins/pre-compiling-dependencies.html)), Carthage and SPM pre-builds framework by default.**

**closed-source allows you to close the source code and save build time, but can have issues with [Application Binary Interface(ABI) stability](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59271017/4770877)**

### Usage

*Environment*
MacBook Pro: Apple M1 Pro
macOS: Sonoma 14.5
Xcode: 15.4
Swift Language Version: Swift 5

----

In Getting Started, a simple command-line tool is built with the Swift Package Manager.

To provide a more complete look at what the Swift Package Manager can do, the following example consists of four interdependent packages:

PlayingCard - Defines PlayingCard, Suit, and Rank types.
FisherYates - Defines an extension that implements the shuffle() and shuffleInPlace() methods.
DeckOfPlayingCards - Defines a Deck type that shuffles and deals an array of PlayingCard values.
Dealer - Defines an executable that creates a DeckOfPlayingCards, shuffles it, and deals the first 10 cards.
You can build and run the complete example by downloading the source code of the Dealer project from GitHub and running the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/apple/example-package-dealer.git
$ cd example-package-dealer
$ swift run dealer <count>
```

### Step1: Creation and Source Control

The creation of a new Swift Package with Xcode is fairly easy and self-explanatory: Just choose ‚ÄúFile‚Äù from the menu bar and ‚ÄúNew‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúPackage...‚Äù -> ‚ÄùMultiplatform - Library‚Äù.

In the following window I gave the new Swift Package a name ‚Äî ‚ÄúXXXPackage‚Äù ‚Äî and put the new package under source control by choosing the checkbox: ‚ÄùCreate Git repository on my Mac‚Äù.

Then I clicked on ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù . If I had forgotten to put the package under source control, I could have done it afterwards by choosing ‚ÄúSource Control‚Äù from the menu bar and ‚ÄúNew Git Repositories‚Äù, Then ‚ÄùNew XXXPakage Remote...‚Äù.

![](../image/developer/spm-1.png)

Add github account with Personal Access Token (must have these scopes set: admin:public_key, write:discussion, repo, user)

[Create a Token on Github](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

![](../image/developer/github-access-token.png)

![](../image/developer/add_github_account.png)

You can choose to make the new remote repository public or private.

### Step2: Add submodule dependencies

```
// swift-tools-version: 5.10
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "XXXPackage",
    products: [
        // Products define the executables and libraries a package produces, making them visible to other packages.
        .library(
            name: "XXXPackage",
            targets: ["XXXPackage"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "git@github.com:<organization>/<repo-name>.git", branch: "<branch-name>")
    ],
    targets: [
        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package, defining a module or a test suite.
        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package and products from dependencies.
        .target(
            name: "XXXPackage"),
        .testTarget(
            name: "XXXPackageTests",
            dependencies: ["XXXPackage"]),
    ]
)

```

**[Do we need prebuild?](https://github.com/leavez/cocoapods-binary/issues/168)**
I did some experiment to check in which case xcode will rebuild imported libraries.
and I found that, xcode will not rebuild the libraries(imported by cocoapod) that doesn't have code change since the last build.
I check this by looking at the build log carefully.
so just want to confirm this & get clear in which situation I need cocoapod-binary.

Project Introduction

CocoaPods Binary Cache is a plug-in for CocoaPods. Its main function is to pre-compile Pod libraries and store them in a remote repository for quick access and reuse on different machines. In this way, each time a new build is made, it no longer takes a lot of time to compile existing libraries, but directly pulls them from the cache, which greatly improves the construction speed of the project.

Technical Analysis

This plug-in is written in Ruby and is compatible with Ruby 2.4 and above and CocoaPods 1.5.0 and above. It uses Bundler for dependency management and uses CocoaPods as the basic dependency management tool. In addition, it uses the two projects cocoapods-rome and cocoapods-binary to achieve Pod pre-compilation and storage.

Application Scenarios

It is suitable for any large Xcode project that needs to be built frequently or across machines, especially in a continuous integration (CI) environment. If your team has multiple people collaborating, or your project relies on a large number of CocoaPods libraries, this plug-in will greatly improve your work efficiency.

Project Features

Reduce build time - Precompile and store Pod frameworks to avoid repeated compilation.
Share across machines - Cached binaries can be shared by multiple developers or CI servers.
Simple configuration - Just add a line of code to the Podfile and configure the cache repository to enable the plugin.
Flexible CLI - Provides multiple command line interfaces, such as fetch, prebuild, and push, to facilitate the management and update of caches.

Requirements

Ruby: >= 2.4
CocoaPods: >= 1.5.0
Via Bundler

To update CocoaPods you simply install the gem again

`$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods`

A CocoaPods plugin to integrate pods in form of prebuilt frameworks, not source code, by adding just one flag in podfile. Speed up compiling dramatically.

*Why*

You may wonder why CocoaPods doesn't have a function to integrate libs in form of binaries, if there are dozens or hundreds of pods in your podfile and compile them for a great many times meaninglessly. Too many source code of libs slow down your compile and the response of IDE (e.g. code completion), and then reduce work efficiency, leaving us time to think about the meaning of life.

This plugin implements this simple wish. Replace the source code in pod target with prebuilt frameworks.

Why don't use Carthage? While Carthage also integrates libs in form of frameworks, there several reasons to use CocoaPods with this plugin:

- Pod is a good simple form to organize files, manage dependencies. (private or local pods)
- Fast switch between source code and binary, or partial source code, partial binaries.
- Some libs don't support Carthage.

### Installation

`$ sudo gem install cocoapods-binary`

```
sudo gem install cocoapods cocoapods-binary
sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods cocoapods-binary
```

```

### Usage

**Customizable xcodebuild option for the prebuild action ([detail](https://github.com/leavez/cocoapods-binary/blob/fe6d66649b88833f4472b39743563cbd9d2100ca/lib/cocoapods-binary/Main.rb#L27)). (So dSYM, archs and more other things are in your control.)**

```[!] Your Podfile requires that the plugin `cocoapods-binary` be installed. Please install it and try installation again.```

**Add the gem cocoapods-binary-cache to the Gemfile of your project.**

`gem "cocoapods-binary-cache", :git => "https://github.com/grab/cocoapods-binary-cache.git", :tag => "0.1.11"`

`gem "cocoapods-binary", :git => "https://github.com/leavez/cocoapods-binary.git", :tag => "v0.4.1"`

**Then, run `bundle install` to install the added gem.**

In case you're not familiar with [bundler](https://bundler.io/), take a look at [Learn how to set it up here](https://www.mokacoding.com/blog/ruby-for-ios-developers-bundler/).

```
plugin 'cocoapods-binary'

use_frameworks!
# all_binary!

target "HP" do
    pod "ExpectoPatronum", :binary => true
end
```

Add plugin `cocoapods-binary` in the head of Podfile
Add `:binary => true` as a option of one specific pod, or add `all_binary!` before all targets, which makes all pods binaries.
`pod install`, and that's all

Note: cocoapods-binary require `use_frameworks!`. If your worry about the boot time and other problems introduced by dynamic framework, static framework is a good choice. Another [plugin](https://github.com/leavez/cocoapods-static-swift-framework) made by me to make all pods static frameworks is recommended.

```
$ bundle exec pod install --no-repo-update --verbose

I have the same problem. Although I can use version 0.4.1 on an ad hoc basis.
I updated my Gemfile to this:
```
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'cocoapods', '~> 1.10.0'
gem 'cocoapods-binary', '0.4.1'
```
```

failed.
Revision 0.4.1 does not exist in the repository https://github.com/leavez/cocoapods-binary.git. Maybe you misspelled it?
If this error persists you could try removing the cache directory '/Users/xxx/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.7.5/cache/bundler/git/cocoapods-binary-b00c3629553e161546c77edd9809eb9d2b0b7ea1'
```
`$ rm -rf /Users/xxx/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.7.5/cache/bundler/git/cocoapods-binary-b00c3629553e161546c77edd9809eb9d2b0b7ea1`

Is the accepted workaround to just run `gem uninstall cocoapods-binary` and then `gem install cocoapods-binary -v 0.4.1` to downgrade to 0.4.1? That seems to work for me. 

**Same issue here, but downgrading to 0.4.1 didn't help me...**

You can fix this by hand Ôºåfor example
`Pods/Target Support Files/AFNetworking/AFNetworking-copy-dsyms-output-files.xcfilelist`

Delete duplicate linesÔºåleft only one line
`${DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH}/AFNetworking.framework.dSYM`

Cumbersome to delete all duplicate lines in all `output-files.xcfilelist` and `input-files.xcfilelist` files, but surprised the issue was that simple.
If you want to fix this automatically you can put this in your `Podfile`.
```
post_integrate do |installer|
  patch_cocoapods_binary_dsyms(installer)
end

def patch_cocoapods_binary_dsyms(installer)
  installer.generated_projects.each do |project|
    project.targets.each do |target|
      target.shell_script_build_phases.each do |phase|
        
        shell_file = phase.shell_script.strip.gsub!(/\A"|"\Z/, '').delete_prefix "${PODS_ROOT}"
        shell_file = File.join("./Pods", shell_file)
        
        shell_script = File.read(shell_file, chomp: true)
        fixed_shell_script = shell_script.gsub("\"${DERIVED_FILES_DIR}\"", "\"${DERIVED_FILES_DIR}/\"")

        File.open(shell_file, "w") do |f|
          f.write(fixed_shell_script)
        end
        
        phase.input_file_list_paths.each do |file_list_path|
          dedupe_file_list(file_list_path)
        end
        
        phase.output_file_list_paths.each do |file_list_path|
          dedupe_file_list(file_list_path)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

def dedupe_file_list(file_list_path)
  file_list_path = file_list_path.delete_prefix "${PODS_ROOT}"
  file_list_path = File.join("./Pods", file_list_path)
  
  contents = File.readlines(file_list_path, chomp: true)
  contents = contents.uniq
  File.open(file_list_path, "w") do |file|
    file.puts contents
  end
end
```

### Options

**If you want to disable binary for a specific pod when using `all_binary!`, place a `:binary => false` to it.**

If your Pods folder is excluded from git, you may add `keep_source_code_for_prebuilt_frameworks!` in the head of Podfile to speed up pod install, as it won't download all the sources every time prebuilt pods have changes.

If bitcode is needed, add a `enable_bitcode_for_prebuilt_frameworks!` before all targets in Podfile

*Performance Optimization Results*

According to official benchmarks, in a project with multiple commonly used libraries, using the plugin can achieve about 10% build time optimization. This is undoubtedly a big improvement in large-scale projects.

*Conclusion*

The CocoaPods binary cache plugin brings a new speed experience to iOS development with its simple design and powerful performance. We strongly recommend that all projects facing build time issues try to adopt this technology. Join now and enjoy a faster development process!
